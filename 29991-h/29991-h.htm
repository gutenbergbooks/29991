<h3>ANTWERP, ON THE SCHELDT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Oh! how glad I am that part of the trip is
over, now we've crossed from England to Antwerp
without being wrecked!"</p>

<p>"You certainly did seem to have a bad time
of it, Tubby, in the wash of the Channel!"</p>

<p>"Bad time did you say, Rob? It was a great
deal worse than anything we struck on the voyage
between New York and Liverpool, let me
tell you."</p>

<p>"But now we want to forget all our troubles
of the past, Tubby."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean by that, Merritt; it's
just the same as telling me the worst is yet to
come."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a little afraid myself that's go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ing
to turn out a fact. Here we are, just landed
in a strange country that is being overrun
by an army of German invaders; and all of us
are bound to push deeper and deeper into the
mire."</p>

<p>"Hey, Merritt, you give me a shiver when you
say that, don't you know?"</p>

<p>"I guess you must mean a quiver, Tubby;
because whenever you laugh or tremble you
make me think of a bowl full of jelly!"</p>

<p>"Now you're making sport of me because I'm
so pudgy and fat. Just as if I could help that;
can I, Rob?"</p>

<p>"To be sure you couldn't, Tubby; and we
wouldn't want you to be anything but what you
are&mdash;the best natured scout in the whole Eagle
Patrol, and I'm safe in saying you're the only
fellow in the Long Island town of Hampton
who hasn't an enemy. Everybody takes a fancy
to a jolly rolypoly like you, Tubby."</p>

<p>"What would we do without you?" Merritt
added, with real feeling in his voice.</p>

<p>"Well, but it strikes me you tried mighty hard
to induce me not to join you two on this won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>derful
trip abroad," complained the fat boy reproachfully.</p>

<p>"There was a good reason for that, Tubby,"
defended Merritt quickly. "I could see that with
all these Old World countries in a scrap, my job
of finding that man who is wanted so badly by
my grandfather might take me into the fighting
zone. Now Rob, as the leader of the Eagle Patrol,
volunteered to stand by me, and I gladly
accepted his assistance. When you asked to go
along I was afraid the hardships of the trip
might be too much for one of your peculiar
build. That's all, I give you my word for it,
Tubby."</p>

<p>"My 'peculiar build,' as you call it, Merritt,"
chuckled the other, considerably mollified by the
explanation offered, "has gotten me into a peck of
trouble, I admit. But you never saw me show
the white feather, did you?"</p>

<p>"Never, Tubby!" admitted the boy addressed,
who was a rather thoughtful looking young
chap, of athletic build, though possibly not quite
the equal of Rob Blake, the leader of the scout
patrol to which all of them belonged. "It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>mighty good of you two to back me up when I'd
decided to take the risk alone. But unless that
precious paper can be recovered, my grandfather,
you know, stands to lose what he says is an enormous
amount of money."</p>

<p>"He's got plenty in reserve, I understand,
Merritt," observed Blake. "What a grand thing
that turned out for your folks when Grandfather
Merritt, who had cut your dad out of his will
many years ago after he married against his
wishes, repented of his cruelty, and paid you an
unexpected visit to get acquainted. Little did
you think, when you stood up for that old fellow
who was being snowballed so unmercifully
by a bunch of village boys, that it was your own
grandfather."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Tubby, "you know they say a
good action is never thrown away. That's why
I'm always watching for my opportunities. Some
day I hope to win the admiration of a crank millionaire
who should, of course, make me his heir."</p>

<p>"Well, here we are landed in Antwerp, and
with a lot of sights to gather in before we set out
in the direction of Brussels to find your man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Every minute counts, so let's get busy, and begin
to wander around."</p>

<p>"That's right, Rob," said Merritt. "Suppose
you lead the way."</p>

<p>These boys, who were all dressed in the well-known
khaki that distinguishes scouts in nearly
every country of the world, had just landed from
a steamer that reached Antwerp from the shores
of England.</p>

<p>They had managed to get themselves and few
belongings conveyed to a fair hotel by means of
a vehicle drawn by a broken-down horse; all of
the best animals as well as such automobiles as
were deemed worth taking having been commandeered
by the Government for cavalry, field and
artillery purposes.</p>

<p>While Rob Blake and his two chums, Tubby
Hopkins and Merritt Crawford, are thus starting
out to secure their first view of the quaint
Flanders city, we may take occasion to glance
back and see who they are and what they have
done.</p>

<p>Those who have had the pleasure of reading
previous volumes of this series need no further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>introduction to the trio; but for the benefit of
any who are now making their acquaintance for
the first time, a few paragraphs may not come
in amiss.</p>

<p>There were other patrols in the Hampton
Troop, but as the Eagles had been first in the
field, the members of this organization were
looked upon as the pioneers of the scout movement
in that part of Long Island.</p>

<p>Rob filled the post of patrol leader, and had,
on one occasion, even occupied the position of
assistant scout-master, being fully qualified for
the certificate he had received from Scout Headquarters
in New York City.</p>

<p>Merritt, the second in command, filled the position
of corporal. Tubby thus far seemed content
to remain just a scout, though he had, by
dint of hard labor managed to climb into the first
grade rank.</p>

<p>Until recently, Merritt's folks had been in just
ordinary circumstances. His father was said to
be the best wheelwright in the eastern end of the
island, and by constant labor kept his little fam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>ily
housed and clothed, and perhaps laid up a little
for a rainy day.</p>

<p>Merritt always knew there was some sort of a
family skeleton around, and that he had a severe
old grandfather somewhere far away; but beyond
that he had never been able to probe.</p>

<p>One day, near the end of the preceding winter,
had come the singular little incident that wound
up in a joyful reunion. Merritt, as one of his
chums chanced to remark a little further back in
this story, had come upon several village roughs
engaged in battering a stranger in town, a little
old gentleman who, carrying his grip and finding
the hacks all away from the station, had evidently
attempted to walk to the hotel.</p>

<p>The cowardly assault aroused the indignation
of Merritt, who was a manly boy at all times. He
remonstrated with the assailants, and when they
continued to pelt the old man, he proceeded to
attack them. Whether he could have won out
alone and unaided will always be an open question.
Fortunately one of the town policemen
chanced to come in sight, which event caused the
three foes to vanish in hot haste.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>Then imagine the astonishment of Merritt
when, after giving the old gentleman his name at
the other's urgent request, he found himself being
hugged by the stranger. He announced himself
as Merritt's repentant grandfather who, unable
to keep up his bitter feud longer, had sought the
forgiveness of his son.</p>

<p>Just what came up later to start these three
boys across the water during vacation time, when
the Old World was commencing to rock and
heave in the throes of the most terrible war ever
known, will be made clear as the story progresses.</p>

<p>The first volume in the series, <i>The Boy Scouts
of the Eagle Patrol</i>, was necessarily confined to
the activities of the young organization; but Rob
and his mates met and overcame many difficulties
that are well worth reading about.</p>

<p>In the second volume, <i>The Boy Scouts on the
Range</i>, were recounted a series of strange adventures
that befell some of the Eagles during a
visit to the Far Southwest, where they took part
in the wild life of a cattle ranch.</p>

<p>Through the pages of <i>The Boy Scouts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>the Army Airship</i> the reader will find that Rob
and his comrades always bore themselves manfully,
no matter the emergency; and that they
scrupulously observed "scout law" under any and
every occasion, as every true wearer of the khaki
makes it a point to do.</p>

<p>After this, followed an account of many remarkable
happenings that befell the Eagles when
under canvas. <i>The Boy Scouts' Mountain Camp</i>
has deservedly been reckoned one of the very
best scout books ever published for boys, and
those who own a copy are likely to read it many
times.</p>

<p>Once more, chance allowed some of the leading
characters in the Hampton Troop to come in
touch with Government officers who were experimenting
with a wonderfully designed submarine.
It happened that Rob and his friends were enabled
to assist Uncle Sam's agents in defeating
the plans of foreign spies who tried to steal the
design of the new invention. In the pages of
<i>The Boy Scouts for Uncle Sam</i> are recorded
the adventures that accompanied their service,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>as well as mention of the reward following their
victory.</p>

<p>It was a happy chance that allowed some of
the boys to pay a visit to the then uncompleted
Panama Canal. While in the Canal Zone they
again demonstrated that they were always wide-awake
and devoted to the service of their country.
Much useful information will also be found
between the covers of this volume, called <i>The
Boy Scouts at the Panama Canal</i>.</p>

<p>Once more, Rob and several of his close adherents
were unexpectedly allowed to take a trip.
Andy Bowles, the bugler of the troop, had an uncle
who owned a cattle ranch down in Chihuahua,
in Mexico. He was sick, and unable to go down
himself to dispose of the stock before the fighting
forces of rebels and Federals drove the herds
away. Accordingly, he sent his nephew and several
of his chums to seek General Villa, whom he
had once befriended, and gain his assistance in
selling the valuable stock. The wonderful things
they saw, and the peculiar adventures that came
their way, have all been described in the seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>volume, just preceding this, under the title of
<i>The Boy Scouts Under Fire in Mexico</i>.</p>

<p>That, telling briefly some of the remarkable
things that happened in their career as Boy
Scouts, will have to suffice to introduce Rob and
his two chums to the reader.</p>

<p>Starting out from their hotel, the three American
boys were soon engrossed in their pursuit of
seeing some of the strange sights for which this
old Flemish city on the Scheldt has always been
famous.</p>

<p>While they gazed, and made many amusing
comments, Rob could not help noticing that, in
turn, they attracted considerable attention. He
could give a good guess as to the reason of this.</p>

<p>At that time, with the vast German army
spreading out over most of Belgium, and also
fighting its way to Paris, the good people of Antwerp
were constantly worried over the possibility
of an attack. They had many scares, though as
yet the invaders, after taking Brussels, had not
chosen to invest the big city near the sea. Later
on, as we all know, the time came when their
heavy artillery was turned on the forts of Ant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>werp,
and before the terrible fire from those colossal
German guns, steel domes that had been
called invulnerable were easily battered to pulp.</p>

<p>With the assault and fall of Antwerp we have
nothing to do, at least at present; but possibly
those Flemish people thought the Boy Scouts part
of an English army coming to defend Antwerp.</p>

<p>When Rob and his two chums landed from
England, after crossing on a small steamer, they
found the city choked with fugitives and Belgian
soldiers.</p>

<p>Pushing their way along the crowded sidewalks,
the boys took in all the sights that were so
new to their American eyes. Only Rob had a
small smattering of French, while his companions
could not speak a word of the language. All of
them were utterly ignorant of Flemish, current in
half the homes of Belgium.</p>

<p>The way in which the natives made use of
sturdy-looking dogs, harnessed in small carts, and
trained to do their duty in order to earn their
keep, was perhaps the most interesting thing that
held their attention.</p>

<p>"Why," remarked Merritt, "they use dogs for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>nearly everything. Dozens of milk peddlers have
teams to drag their big brass cans around. Then
there are the hucksters, like we have over in New
York, only these fellows peddle from carts drawn
by dogs. We saw one poor, four-footed wretch
roped to a treadmill, and doing the family churning;
so I guess Belgium must make the dog traffic
pay right well."</p>

<p>"And think of dogs drawing a quick-firing gun,
which we saw in that street where the soldiers
were getting ready to go to the front!" exclaimed
Tubby. "I think that was the queerest sight
ever."</p>

<p>"I can plainly see," Rob told them, "that while
we're over here we are bound to keep our eyes
wide open all the time because there are so many
things that strike us as being queer just because
we've been used to other ways. These people
would stare at many of the things we think are
common."</p>

<p>"What are you looking at now, Tubby?" asked
Merritt, seeing that the boy, who had gained his
name because after a fashion he resembled a tub
of butter, was in the act of stretching his fat neck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>in order to see something that had attracted his
attention.</p>

<p>"Why, I was wondering what made all the
people crook their necks like that, and look up
in the air. Is there a German Zeppelin heaving
in sight? I don't seem to glimpse any big dirigible
up there; do you, fellows?"</p>

<p>"What's that moving along away up near the
clouds?" demanded Merritt.</p>

<p>"It must be an aëroplane," said Tubby. "I
just heard somebody say my name close by; but
he pointed up at that flier. What could he have
meant, Rob?"</p>

<p>"I think I can tell you," replied the other scout.
"German aëroplanes are called Taubes, and it
sounded like your name. They say that is an
aëroplane spy up there!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE AERIAL MAP-MAKER.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"He's flying pretty high, let me tell you," said
Tubby, straining his neck in an endeavor to
watch the evolutions of the far-distant object
sailing on the border of the cloud, and which
looked so much like a great bird with outstretched
wings.</p>

<p>"And all the while he is using his powerful
field-glass to watch things going on below," added
Rob. "I wouldn't be surprised if those chaps
make a rough map, as they go over a place, with
the position of forts marked, and the disposition
of troops. In this war they say aëroplanes and
dirigibles are going to play great stunts."</p>

<p>"Think of the nerve of that German aviator,
sailing right over Antwerp in broad daylight!"
Tubby declared. "It's a dare, all right, and I
wonder if any of these Belgian fliers will take
him up. I really think I'd like to see a little scrap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>up in the air. We didn't have a chance for anything
of that sort since we were down in Mexico
with Villa."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Merritt, "you may see more
of that kind of business over here than you want.
These fliers don't go circling around just to spy
on the enemy. In lots of cases they have another
and more terrible mission."</p>

<p>"Oh!" ejaculated the fat scout uneasily, "now
you're thinking of that visit paid by a Zeppelin to
Antwerp a short time back when it dropped a
bomb that smashed things to flinders. They say
it was aimed at the king's palace. But you don't
think now that fellow away up there in the
clouds would bother dropping explosives on our
heads, do you, Rob?"</p>

<p>Tubby always appealed to the patrol leader
when bothered about anything. To hear him talk
you would imagine that he considered Rob Blake
a walking encyclopedia, and capable of answering
any kind of question.</p>

<p>"No, he's flying too high for that," the other
told him confidently. "You see, with the air currents,
that we know something about ourselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>no one at that height could count on landing his
explosive anywhere near the place he wanted it
to go. Chances are that chap is only out on a
spying trip. Aëroplane pilots are the scouts of
the air these days, you understand. Nothing can
be hidden from them."</p>

<p>"I understand," ventured Merritt, as they continued
to watch the circling of the lofty observer
and map-maker, "that there can be no surprises
in this war, because the enemy always knows all
about the massing of troops long before an attack
can be delivered. An eagle or a hawk, hovering
over shallow water, can see every bit of bottom
when the surface is still, and so he's able to
pounce down on the fish he's selected for dinner.
These wonderful air-pilots will bring information
of every contemplated move on the part of
the enemy."</p>

<p>"Poor old Napoleon would be a back number in
these days," Tubby sighed, "because you remember
his strongest card was to divide the enemy,
and then smash one army and then the other.
They'd know all about his game in time to block
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>it. The romance of war has gone glimmering,
I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Listen to all that shouting," said Merritt.</p>

<p>"Seems to be cheers, as well as these people
can cheer, which is not like the good old United
States way," Tubby commented.</p>

<p>"You can see what it means," remarked Rob.
"There goes a Belgian biplane up, to get after the
bold German!"</p>

<p>"My stars!" gasped Tubby. "Now we <i>will</i> see
a circus! Think of two rival pilots maneuvering
up there among the clouds, and trying to knock
each other out! Whew! But watch him boring
up in spirals, would you? Does the German see
him, do you think, and is he beginning to skip
out?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like that has happened yet, as far as
I can see," admitted Rob. "There he starts
around again, as if meaning to complete his map,
no matter if a dozen Belgian or English airmen
come up after him."</p>

<p>"It'll be a fight, then, see if it doesn't!" Tubby
affirmed.</p>

<p>"There goes a second aëroplane, and this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>a monoplane," Merritt told them, pointing as he
spoke. "Unless I miss my guess, there's an English
aviator in that machine. It doesn't carry the
little Belgian flag the other does, you notice."</p>

<p>"Two against one," muttered the deeply interested
Tubby. "Better be making up your mind to
turn tail and run, Mr. Deutschland. The odds
are against you, and, if you should get tumbled
out of your seat a mile high, I'd hate to be under
you when you strike the ground."</p>

<p>"They seem to be maneuvering for position,"
asserted Rob. "Yes, both are circling around
now, and going still higher all the time. Before
long the German will be hidden in that cloud
bank, and that's what he's aiming to have happen."</p>

<p>"I thought I saw something like a little puff
of smoke just then!" declared Merritt, who had
exceptionally good eyes, strong almost as those
of an eagle.</p>

<p>"Then they must be bombarding each other!"
Tubby ventured to say, evidently greatly thrilled
by the spectacle that could never have been
dreamed of a few generations back.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>"It's likely they are using their automatics, and
trying to disable each other," admitted Rob,
"though, between us, Merritt, I don't believe the
tiny puff of smoke could be seen away down here,
unless you had a strong glass. Of course, when
moving as fast as they do, the chance of making
a shot tell is next door to nix."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, they're chasing the German aëroplane
off," Tubby declared. "That is the main
object for the brave Belgians going up there."</p>

<p>The boys had made up their minds while on
the way across that as Americans they must obey
the President's appeal and be strictly neutral, if
it were possible. They had many good friends
who were of German descent, while others had
English ancestors and near relatives.</p>

<p>The one country with which they sympathized
deeply was Belgium. The stubborn and heroic
way in which that seven millions of people had
defied seventy millions, and the gallant manner in
which their little army had tried to resist the
invasion of their beloved country, had aroused
the admiration of every one of the scouts.</p>

<p>As they stood there on that afternoon, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>watched, they finally saw the German Taube vanish
in the clouds, with the leading Belgian aëroplane
following suit. Whether the pursuer
ever overtook the foreign air-scout or not, the
boys never learned.</p>

<p>"Well, that was a lively little tilt while it lasted,"
remarked Merritt as, the entertainment being
over, the crowds again commenced sauntering
back and forth, with everybody talking volubly
about the spectacle in the heavens.</p>

<p>Soldiers gave them a curious look in passing.
Every stranger in Antwerp was under more or
less suspicion in those days, for it was becoming
known that the German secret service had
for years maintained the most wonderful system
of spying in France, England and Belgium
ever dreamed of. Antwerp had thousands of
Teuton residents before the war, some of them
leading merchants who owned splendid country
places six or seven miles outside the city, where
solid cement tennis courts afterward came in
very handy as foundations for the immense German
siege guns.</p>

<p>"We'll see plenty more things that will give us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>a thrill to beat that," Rob observed, pushing
through the bustling, chattering crowds.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm afraid times may come when
danger will hang over our heads," Merritt pursued,
with a touch of regret in his voice. "Then
you'll both be sorry you didn't let me go off on
this wild goose chase, as it may turn out to be,
by myself."</p>

<p>"What do you take us for, I want to know?"
demanded Rob. "Haven't we been through all
sorts of tough times together in the past; and
why shouldn't we stand by our chum when he
needs our help? What's a scout good for if he
is ready to desert a comrade when the sky grows
dark? That's just the time to show his true colors."</p>

<p>"You're taking the very words out of my
mouth when you say that, Rob!" asserted Tubby
valiantly. "No matter what happens, we're
bound by the ties of old friendship. We'll sink
or swim together, boys. And Merritt, please
don't ever tell us again you're feeling sorry for
letting us come along."</p>

<p>"If that man is to be found, we're going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>corner him!" declared Rob, with his lips taking
on the firm lines that marked them whenever
he was making up his mind to hammer away persistently,
like Grant did before Richmond; "and
when we go back to the other side, we hope to be
carrying that precious old paper your grandfather
let get out of his possession in such a queer way."</p>

<p>"This seems like a pretty warm day to me,
even for summer," observed Tubby irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Now, we can give a pretty good guess, Rob,"
ventured Merritt smilingly, "that Tubby has a
sly meaning back of that remark."</p>

<p>"Yes," added the patrol leader, "and the
chances are three to one it has something to do
with feeding."</p>

<p>"You are champion guessers, both of you,"
Tubby informed them, without seeming to be in
the least ashamed of the confession. "I'm consumed
by a violent thirst right now; and I bet you
the milk in that shiny brass can that those two
tired dogs have been dragging all over Antwerp
this afternoon will have a lump of ice in it. Anyway,
I'm going to test it; come along and let me
stand treat."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>Laughing at his earnestness, the others followed
the fat scout across the street, where the
old woman with her dog team was apparently
resting, and observing the remarkably interesting
sights around her.</p>

<p>Just then there were loud cheers that attracted
the attention of the three boys.</p>

<p>"Something else coming along that's worth
seeing," Merritt announced. "Better curb that
fierce thirst of yours for a minute or two, Tubby,
while we watch what's passing."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, I guess the milk won't sour while
we're waiting," admitted the fat boy with a sigh
of resignation, as he wheeled so as to face the
street.</p>

<p>"What do you call that, I wonder?" remarked
Merritt, as he looked. "It's got the wheels of
an automobile; but say, notice how the body of
the car has been built up with steel sides, will
you? And as sure as you live there's a quick firing
Maxim mounted behind that bullet shield."</p>

<p>"Now I know what it is," Rob hastened to
say.</p>

<p>"Then tell us, please," urged Tubby helplessly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>"They call them armored cars," said the patrol
leader. "I've read about how some of these reckless
Belgians have fitted up cars in this way.
Nearly every day they start out to raid through
the country, where they expect to run across detachments
of Uhlans, or bicycle squads of the
German advance. Then they dart down on them
and do some terrible work; before the enemy
can recover to smash them, they are off like a
flash, and return to town with all sorts of trophies."</p>

<p>"They must have just been coming in," ventured
Merritt. "I saw one of the soldiers had a
bandage around his head. Another was holding
up two helmets which must have been worn by
Uhlans. And listen how the crowds roar and
cheer. They certainly do hate the Kaiser and
his army in Antwerp."</p>

<p>"Well, do you wonder?" Rob asked. "After
some of their lovely towns have been burnt
down, and thousands of houses destroyed, simply
because these Belgians dared to stand up for
their rights as a neutral nation!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, how about that drink of milk, fellows?"
Tubby wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself, Tubby," Rob told him. "If it
tastes good to you, we might join you in a glass."</p>

<p>"Huh! sort of 'trying it on the dog first,' eh?"
Tubby retorted, and then turning toward the
owner of the dog team and the milk cart, he made
a gesture with his head, and held up three fingers.</p>

<p>Evidently the old woman must have understood
what he meant, though she looked a bit
"peeved," as Tubby afterward expressed it, at
being asked to do a retail business. There were
a number of measures dangling from hooks
around the top of the shining brass milk can,
also several glass "schooners." Taking one of
the latter the old Belgian milk vender was in the
act of filling it from the contents of the can when
something astonishing happened.</p>

<p>Four soldiers who had been passing became
excited, and pointed at the group; then they laid
violent hands on the owner of the milk cart!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>LEAVING FOR THE FRONT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"What's this? What's this?" stammered
Tubby, as the schooner of rich milk fell with a
crash to the pavement when the soldiers began
struggling with the woman vender, who was
also the owner of the dog team.</p>

<p>Of course a crowd collected immediately, as
it always will in a city when there is the first
sign of something doing. Antwerp was fairly
seething with half suppressed excitement at that
time, and anything of this kind was like putting
a match to the powder magazine.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare but she's a husky old woman,
that's right!" Tubby was heard to say after his
astonishment had in a measure abated, and he
could catch his breath. "Why, it takes the whole
four soldiers to subdue her. Shame! to hit a
poor old woman like that; but my stars, don't she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>kick and try to land a blow on some of their
noses."</p>

<p>"Whew! what do you think!" exclaimed Rob
just then, for he had been listening to some of
the chattering on the part of the excited crowd
near by. "It isn't an old woman, after all, but a
man. That explains how he comes to fight as
he does, and why the Belgians keep on treating
him so roughly."</p>

<p>"A man, and dressed up like a woman!" cried
Tubby. "Well, if that isn't a queer stunt, I want
to know. Is he trying to escape military duty,
do you think, Rob? I remember they have conscription
here in Belgium just like in Germany,
Russia and France. Every young fellow has to
serve the colors just so long."</p>

<p>But Rob shook his head. By now the soldiers
had apparently conquered the spirit of the
man in woman's garments. His white Belgian
cap had been torn off in the struggle, showing that
his hair was short underneath. He was also
bleeding from having come in contact with some
hard object, but he now stood there as straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>as any grenadier, and looked his captors contemptuously
in the face.</p>

<p>"They say he's a German spy!" Rob told his
two chums. Tubby again held his breath, and
stared as hard as he could at the prisoner.</p>

<p>The crowd became fairly wild to get at the
captive, and made all manner of violent threats
as they surged around the little group. The milk
can was upset, and the dogs liberated by some
friendly hand ran wildly away, as though knowing
that their temporary master had gotten himself
in a serious scrape.</p>

<p>The four determined Belgian soldiers guarding
their prisoner against the fury of the mob
began to work a way along the pavement, meaning,
no doubt, to land their prize in the lock-up,
where he would be safe until the firing squad
was called on to complete the tragedy.</p>

<p>Presently their signals brought another detachment
of the guard to the spot, a way was speedily
cleared through the dense masses of people,
and that was the last the three scouts saw of the
spy. They could guess his fate, but at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>time felt positive that he must have met it as
a man.</p>

<p>Somehow, the experience gave them a queer
feeling. Here they had been rubbing up against
some of the tragic happenings of the war, and
after being in Antwerp only a few hours. No
wonder they all felt convinced that the signs
pointed to their having some lively times ahead.</p>

<p>"And say, I didn't get my drink of milk, either,
did I?" lamented Tubby, after things settled
back into the old rut again, with that never-ending
procession of citizens, refugees, soldiers, and
even a sprinkling of venturesome foreign tourists
passing by in both directions.</p>

<p>"Oh! that doesn't cut much figure in the matter,"
Merritt told him, "because if you step off
this main street into one of the side <i>gassens</i> you'll
run across plenty of other milk-venders, who will
not turn out to be something else."</p>

<p>"I see one right now," announced the persistent
Tubby, who did not like to give up anything
on which he had set his heart. "And look
at the name of the same, will you: <i>The Street of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>the Steen</i>. Now what does that stand for, Rob?
Is it the same as the German word <i>stein</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, you're away off there, Tubby," he
was immediately told by the patrol leader, who
had studied his guide book to some advantage.
"This Steen used ages ago to be a terrible prison,
where in the days of the Spanish Inquisition they
tortured people in all sorts of ways. Just now
it's a great museum; and if only we had time,
which we don't expect, I'd like nothing better
than to explore it."</p>

<p>"You see," Merritt told them, "if only you
would let me go on by myself, and try to find
Steven Meredith, you might stay around here
and have a fairly decent time, unless the Germans
do really start to try and capture Antwerp,
after all."</p>

<p>"That'll do for you, Merritt," Rob informed
him severely, "you forget that incident is closed."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Tubby, trying to frown, but as
usual making a sorry mess of it, for the lines
of his chubby face refused to take on such an
air, seeing that they were only adapted for smiling,
"don't let us hear another wheeze from you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Merritt. But please come with me, and let's see
if all the old milk-venders of Antwerp are German
spies. I hope the milk isn't poisoned."</p>

<p>"That isn't fair talk, Tubby, because you
know the Germans would be away and above
doing anything like that. They have their faults,
but nobody calls them cowards. In fact, they
seem to be too brave for their own good, because
we hear how they are shot down like ripe
grain, pushing along in masses straight into the
jaws of death, and singing as they go."</p>

<p>This time they were allowed to quaff their
mugs of cool, fresh milk without any unpleasant
incident to interrupt the ceremony. Tubby did
eye the woman who owned the outfit rather suspiciously,
and must have aroused her curiosity
by the way he turned his head several times after
they had walked off.</p>

<p>For another hour the three American scouts
tramped back and forth, seeing all they possibly
could in so short a time. The quaint Flemish
houses, with their many gables, and their red-tiled
roofs, interested them greatly. In some of
the streets the buildings even seemed to lean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>toward one another, and Tubby declared two men
could almost shake hands by stretching from the
upper windows.</p>

<p>"Now we ought to see the burgomaster," said
Rob, as the afternoon waned. "You know you
are carrying a letter to him, Merritt, from your
grandfather, who happens to be acquainted with
him. And we count on getting a guide through
his influence who will take us along the roads
between here and Brussels."</p>

<p>"Even if a guide is not to be found, because
nearly all the men are enlisted in the army," Merritt
replied, "we've made up our minds not to
hold back. Fellows who have had as much experience
in running the gauntlet as the scouts
of the Eagle Patrol can point to, needn't worry
about how they're going to get along."</p>

<p>"Leave that to us," said Tubby, rather pompously;
"and we'll land on our feet all right, just
as a cat does if you drop it out of the second-story
window."</p>

<p>After considerable difficulty, the boys were admitted
to an audience with the mayor or burgomaster
of Antwerp in his official chambers. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>tunately,
he spoke English, so they expected to
meet with little difficulty in acquainting him with
the nature of their mission to Belgium at a time
when nearly all other Americans were only too
well pleased to get away from the land of strife
and warfare.</p>

<p>The burgomaster looked surprised and even
anxious when he heard that they desired an official
paper from him, requesting all Belgians to
assist them in their search for one Steven Meredith,
who was believed to be located in a town
not many miles to the west of the capital.</p>

<p>"I would do much for my old friend, Monsieur
Charles Crawford, for whom I have long entertained
a sincere affection," he told Merritt, after
he had read the letter presented to him, and
questioned the boys at length, "but it is a most
serious undertaking you have in view. I question
the wisdom of my encouraging such a dangerous
trip."</p>

<p>Rob, seeing that the good burgomaster appeared
to be hesitating, and as Tubby expressed
it, "on the fence," started in to talk. Rob had
a very persuasive way about him, as his chums
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>knew from past experiences. They guessed how
it would all turn out as soon as they saw how
impressed the Belgian city official seemed to be
with the arguments the boy brought forward.</p>

<p>Of course, in the end, the burgomaster yielded,
and wrote them out the passport they wanted
so badly. This document would possibly permit
them to go even beyond the lines where the Belgian
army was intrenched, waiting to deal a
blow at the enemy in case the Germans turned
threateningly toward Antwerp.</p>

<p>"I do this much against my will," he told them,
as he was shaking each one by the hand upon
their leaving. "But my old friend has written
me so much that is clever about the faculty you
boys have shown in taking care of yourselves,
that I am in hopes you may get through safely.
But I shall be sad indeed if anything overtakes
you through my giving way to sentiment. I wish
I could influence you to remain here in safety,
and send out some messenger in your stead to
bring this man to Antwerp."</p>

<p>"We have made up our minds to accompany our
friend, the grandson of the Charles Crawford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>you knew, sir," Rob told him, "and all we can
promise is that we mean to be very careful. If
the man you will send around to us as a guide
does his duty faithfully, we hope to get along
fairly well. And believe us, sir, we feel that you
have advised and assisted us even more generously
than Mr. Crawford expected of you. We
thank you a thousand times. Good-bye."</p>

<p>That night passed without anything unusual
happening to disturb the three boys. Their hotel
chanced to be situated in a quiet part of the seething
city, so that they were not at all annoyed
by patriotic outbursts. And boys as a rule have
a happy faculty of losing their troubles in sleep.</p>

<p>With the coming of that next morning all of
them were early astir. After breakfast they
went in search of mounts, having secured some
hints from the proprietor of the hotel.</p>

<p>Horses were certainly at a high premium just
then in Flanders. Nearly every animal of any
worth at all had been taken by the Belgian field
forces for army use. If a few were by accident
hidden, and escaped this search, they were apt
to be discovered by the advancing Germans.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>"It would be of no use, anyway, getting hold
of respectable nags," Rob explained, when he saw
even Tubby gape at sight of the poor looking
animals they had offered to them at exorbitant
prices, "because we'd never have the least chance
to get anywhere on their backs. No matter how
many passes we had from burgomasters, or even
King Albert himself, somebody would be sure
to take them away from us."</p>

<p>"I suppose half a loaf <i>is</i> better than no bread
at all," complained Merritt with vivid recollections
of the fine mounts he and his chums had
sported on several occasions, notably when on
the cattle ranch, and following Mexican war
trails.</p>

<p>"But <i>such</i> a loaf!" sighed Tubby, as he ran his
hand over the bony back of the nearest quadruped,
and wondered whether so weak looking a
horse could long survive under his rather heavy
weight.</p>

<p>"They may turn out a heap better than they
look," Rob told them. "Sometimes it's the bony
horses that can hold the pace in a grueling jour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ney.
But, after all, it's a case of Hobson's choice
with us; either these nags, or walk."</p>

<p>"Whew! better close the bargain then, Merritt;
that is, if you think you can afford the
price," Tubby hastened to say, for as may be
easily understood, he was not very much in love
with protracted walks, not having been built for
a sprinter.</p>

<p>So Merritt bought four horses, and paid cash
down for them, receiving a regular bill of sale
from the dealer, to show they were his property.
With them went old saddles and bridles, good
enough for the purpose of the three scouts, but
not of a type calculated to incite anyone to steal
the same.</p>

<p>All that remained to be looked after now was
that promised guide. If the good burgomaster
of Antwerp kept his promise, they expected to
find a native waiting at the hotel when they
got back after their foray into the limited horse
market.</p>

<p>And sure enough they found a swarthy Belgian
there who said he had been engaged by the mayor
to serve them. Merritt quickly made terms, for
the guide, besides being able to converse in French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>and Flemish, could speak some English, and readily
comprehended all that was said in that tongue;
especially when the subject of a money contract
came under consideration.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to detain us any longer,
boys," remarked Merritt. "We have made up a
little pack apiece which we'd like to take along.
We travel light on this trip, you know; all but
Tubby, and that's something he always gets left
on. The balance of our duffle the proprietor of
the hotel has promised to keep safely until we
show up to claim it again."</p>

<p>"Small loss if we never see any of it again,"
Rob admitted. "At the same time we hope to
come back this way after we've run that person
down, and either recover the paper your grandfather
wants, or learn that it's lost for good."</p>

<p>"That is," corrected Tubby, "we expect to see
Antwerp again if the Germans don't gobble us
up."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see them try it," remarked Merritt,
with a significant look at the ample proportions
of the fat chum. "They'd have their
work cut out, as sure as you live, Tubby."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now, don't get personal again, Merritt," cautioned
the other, holding up a warning forefinger,
"but as there are heaps and heaps of queer
things I'd like to poke into around this town, I
certainly hope to visit it again."</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward, mounted on scrubby
looking horses, which would have excited the derision
of any respectable cowboy in the West,
Rob and his two chums, accompanied by Anthony
Wallenhout, the Belgian guide, passed out of the
city, heading toward the east.</p>

<p>Before they had gone a sixth of a mile they
found themselves stopped by a patrol of soldiers,
led by a young lieutenant, who, it happened, could
speak English.</p>

<p>"It is no use, messieurs," he told them, with
a pleasant smile, but a determined shake of the
head, "you must face the other way and go back.
The enemy is in force in many places between
Brussels and Antwerp, and severe fighting is
going on wherever our brave army has thrown
up entrenchments. Antwerp is the only safe
place for any who speak English, these days."</p>

<h3>THE DAY OF THE BOY SCOUT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Now, wouldn't that jar you!" muttered
Tubby, sprawled on the back of his horse very
much after the manner of a great toad. "Here
we hardly get started on our wonderful trip
over the battlefields of Belgium before we're held
up, and told to fade away. Huh! talk to me about
luck, we seem to have lost our grip."</p>

<p>"Show him what you've got, Merritt," suggested
Rob, who did not give up quite so easily, because
of a sudden snag in the stream.</p>

<p>"Oh! why, yes, how about that passport the
burgomaster wrote out for us himself? It ought
to do the trick!" exclaimed Tubby, his sad look
disappearing like a flash, and an expectant one
appearing in its stead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>The officer scanned the paper which Merritt
handed him.</p>

<p>"At a time like this the burgomaster himself is
under military orders," he told the waiting boys,
"and if it happened to be a matter of much importance
I could not honor his request. It
chances, however, that in this case there is nothing
involved except your safety. And you seem
to be willing to take the risk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because we have a very important piece
of business to carry out," Rob hastened to tell
him, seeing which way the wind was blowing,
and wishing to take advantage of the flood-tide.
"It means a great deal to one of my friends if
we can find a certain man. You will allow us
to go on, then, I hope?"</p>

<p>The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders in real
French style as he handed the burgomaster's
passport back.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you are that rash, young messieurs,"
he said. "We, of the Belgian army, can admire
pluck. You certainly have my best wishes."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, lieutenant!" gushed Tubby,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>who was relieved to know that the enterprise
was not fated to be condemned at the start.</p>

<p>Perhaps the time might come ere long when
the same Tubby would be secretly lamenting over
the fact that it had been given a free swing. But
coming events do not always cast their shadows
before; and just at that moment none of the
venturesome scouts could so much as guess what
awaited them in the disturbed country beyond.</p>

<p>They gave the obliging lieutenant a regular
scout salute, which he returned in kind. The
paper had informed him that Rob and his chums
were members of the Boy Scout organization
in America, so that the fact of their wearing
khaki uniforms was easily understood.</p>

<p>"I hope we have as good luck in skipping past
every obstacle we run up against," Merritt was
saying, as they moved along the road leading
from Antwerp in the direction of the Belgian capital.</p>

<p>"Oh! we mustn't expect to be always as fortunate
as that," said Rob. "I believe in hoping
for the best, and preparing for the worst. It's
good policy all around."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>"Something like we read the Pilgrim Fathers
used to do in the good old days when they used
to ride to church with the wife back of them,"
Tubby explained, "and every man carrying his
gun along. Their motto was 'trust in the Lord;
but keep your powder dry!'"</p>

<p>"That's the idea," agreed Rob. "And so far,
in all our tramps and wanderings, we've managed
to do our part fairly well."</p>

<p>"Let's hope this venture turns out as good,"
Tubby added, with a side glance toward Merritt,
for, of course, it concerned him more than either
of the others whether success or failure resulted
from their trip abroad.</p>

<p>That was only a beginning, for they were soon
held up again. This time it came about that the
soldier in charge of the detachment could not
speak a word of English, so the guide had to
exercise his ability in the line of a translator.</p>

<p>So well did he plead, and explain that they
were all good friends of the burgomaster of Antwerp,
that once again they were allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>Rob could easily see, however, that consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>able
doubt had arisen in the mind of the officer
as to whether he should permit three boys to head
into such a disturbed country as that lying beyond.</p>

<p>Like the lieutenant, he shrugged his shoulders,
and dismissed the matter of responsibility from
his mind. Indeed, there were too many other
serious affairs to be considered just then to bother
about a party of tourists fairly wild to say they
had gazed upon actual battlefields; for, doubtless,
he concluded this was the real reason why
these venturesome boys elected to take chances
in the war zone.</p>

<p>So long as they were not spies in the service
of the enemy it was all right; only he wanted to
warn them that they were apt to meet with some
roving detachment of Germans at almost any
time, since they were overrunning most of the
country, appearing suddenly at villages, and demanding
food and wine, or surprising isolated
stations poorly guarded, so as to hold some important
bridge for the coming of a column.</p>

<p>"Look what's coming whizzing along ahead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>there!" Tubby called out a short time after this
encounter.</p>

<p>There was a little cloud of dust, and they could
see that it was caused by someone mounted on
a bicycle, who was bending down over the handlebars
and working his feet very rapidly.</p>

<p>"Give him the road, fellows; he seems to be in
a big hurry!" ordered Rob.</p>

<p>A minute later and the bicyclist shot by them.
As he did so he straightened up in the saddle,
and to their surprise gave them a regulation scout
salute. Then he went tearing down the road in
that cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" cried Tubby. "Why, he
was a Boy Scout as sure as anything! Now,
what in the wide world was he in such a terrible
hurry for? He acted like he might be late for
his breakfast."</p>

<p>"Just now the Boy Scouts in Belgium have a
good many other things to bother them besides
missing an occasional meal," explained Rob.
"They have been taken over by the military authorities
and are doing splendid work in heaps
of ways."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," added Merritt, as they rode on again,
"I noticed a number of them while we were in
Antwerp, and they seemed to be on the jump
constantly. Every fellow had a badge on his left
arm with the letters 'S. M.' on it. You remember,
Rob, when you asked what they stood for,
you were told the letters meant 'Service Militaire,'
and showed that the boys were working
for the Government."</p>

<p>"What d'ye reckon they find to do?" asked
Tubby, deeply interested.</p>

<p>"They act as dispatch bearers," replied Rob,
"ambulance orderlies, and aids to the police.
They told me that in Brussels, now held by the
Germans, some scouts daily herded the women
who came for their regular ration issued by the
Government, and kept order, too. Everybody
takes them seriously. This is no time for play
among the Boy Scouts of Belgium, when war
has gripped their native land."</p>

<p>"When we were over in England," Merritt
related, "I made it a point to find out how all
the scouts there were being made use of. It
gave me a mighty proud feeling to know that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>was authorized to wear the uniform of the Eagle
Patrol; for there never was a time in the history
of the world when boys were of as much
use as now."</p>

<p>"But there have been no battles on English
soil, up to now, Merritt; tell me how the Boy
Scouts of Great Britain could do things, then?"
asked Tubby, who it seems could not have been
bothering himself very much when his chums
were making all these observations.</p>

<p>Merritt took a slip of paper from his pocket.
They were riding slowly at the time, indeed at
all times, for the horses did not seem desirous
of making any particular speed.</p>

<p>"Here's an account I clipped from an English
paper while we were in London," he told Tubby.
"It tells a lot of things the scouts have taken
to doing in order to assist; for, during the war,
school duties have been mostly dropped."</p>

<p>"Oh! what joy!" cried Tubby; "but go and read
it out to us, Merritt."</p>

<p>"Here's what the account says, then," Merritt
told them, as he managed to read from the
slip: "'Acting as guides to troops. Forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>ing
dispatches dropped from air craft. Coastguard
work, such as watching estuaries, guiding
vessels in unbuoyed channels, and showing lights
to friendly vessels!'"</p>

<p>"Whew!" remarked Tubby; "that sounds fine
to me, Merritt. For once I almost wish I happened
to be a Johnny Bull boy instead of an Uncle
Sam. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"It's only the beginning," he was told. "Listen
to some more work a scout can do for his country
over there. 'Collecting information as to
available supplies and transports. Helping the
families of men at the front. First aid; fitting
up nursing stations, refuges, dispensaries, and
kitchens in their own club rooms. Carrying on
organized relief of the destitute. Guarding and
patrolling bridges, culverts, telegraph lines, and
water supplies. Serving as dispatch bearers, telegraph
and mail delivery riders; and distributing
millions of notices as to billeting, commandeering,
safety precautions, and the like,' How's that
strike you, Tubby?"</p>

<p>"It certainly gives me a thrill," the fat boy replied,
"and I envy the lucky Boy Scouts of Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Britain. I reckon they're doing things like that
down in France. Yes, and in Germany too. Now
people will see what it means to wear the khaki
uniform. I'm prouder than ever because I have
that right."</p>

<p>"They say," remarked Rob, chiming in with
what knowledge he had picked up, "that for once
the boys are appreciated in these times. They
have at last come into their own. A scout's uniform
is regarded in England as a sign of competence
and responsibility. It is treated with
the same respect given to any other official garb."</p>

<p>"This account goes on to say that the boys
have developed a wonderful topographical knowledge,"
Merritt continued, full of the subject as
any Boy Scout might well be. "They pack ambulances
systematically with instruments and
medical supplies, checking off their lists like experienced
quartermasters. Others take charge
of the delivery of camp outfits from the stores
to the troops about to embark for the seat of
war. The bicycle corps and mounted squads
can care for their machines and horses, make high
speed, and meet emergencies with decision and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>intelligence. The signal corps can use the telegraph
key, semaphore, and flags almost as well
as veterans, thanks to their training. They can
repair telegraph lines and instruments, and have
considerable knowledge of wireless."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" exclaimed Tubby. "This is sure
the day of the Boy Scout. I never thought I'd
ever live to see him climb to such a dazzling
height. Of course, over in America, scouts have
never been trained with any idea that they might
be soldiers; for we don't have a chip on our
shoulder all the time, and feel that we're spoiling
for a fight."</p>

<p>"All the same," said Rob, "the time may come
when what we've learned will be of great use
to our country. Besides, every boy is ten times
better off for joining the organization."</p>

<p>They had been riding in this fashion for an
hour and more, often meeting parties of fugitives
on the road, some of them bearing household
treasures, leading a mooing cow, or driving a
spavined old horse that was attached to a shaky
wagon piled up with goods of value to the owners
only.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>These sights at first struck the boys as pitiful.
They would in time become so accustomed
to them that such spectacles must be taken as
a part of the war game; still, all of them were
sure that in this case "familiarity would not
breed contempt."</p>

<p>Then at times it happened that houses were
scarce, and a stretch of the road, from some reason
or other, ahead appeared deserted. Often, in
the distance, they heard strange sounds like far-away
thunder. It thrilled them to imagine that
possibly this was the roar of big guns; perhaps
they were even drawing near to an actual battlefield!</p>

<p>About this time the boys noticed that their
guide was acting as though excited.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Anthony?" asked Rob,
bent on knowing the worst.</p>

<p>In his broken English the Belgian guide tried
to tell them his fears.</p>

<p>"Look you&mdash;over thisaways&mdash;you see men,
horses&mdash;they run thisaway, they run thataway&mdash;some
shake hands at us&mdash;I do not know, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>may be they will turn out to be Uhlan cavalrymen&mdash;bad
men who ride far in advance of the army,
to screen movements of troops. If they are Uhlans,
we may not go ahead further!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>UNDER THE BRIDGE.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Of course what Anthony told them caused the
boys more or less concern. They had no desire
to fall into the hands of the Germans. While it
could not be said that they were against the invaders,
the terrible stories they had heard in
Antwerp, even if only a small part were true,
gave them an unpleasant feeling toward the
Kaiser's men.</p>

<p>That word Uhlan was dreaded by every Belgian
or native of Northern France. While it
really stands for the cavalry arm of the German
forces, still, ever since the Franco-Prussian
war of more than forty years ago, it has possessed
a terrible significance all its own. Humble
peasants shivered when they pronounced it, and
no doubt many an unruly child was threatened
with the coming of the terrible Uhlans unless it
mended its ways.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>"If that's the case, then," Merritt voiced the
opinion of himself and chums by saying hurriedly,
"we want to get out of this. It's a case
of either run or hide with us."</p>

<p>"But where could we hide?" asked Tubby,
looking all around him helplessly. "Just now
there isn't a single cottage in sight; and the bare
fields around don't offer much shelter, seems to
me."</p>

<p>"There's a bridge just ahead of us," said Rob.</p>

<p>"And we might manage to get our mounts
down underneath," added Merritt instantly,
grasping the idea that was in the patrol leader's
mind. "The bank slopes easy enough to allow
of it."</p>

<p>"Eet could be done, Messieurs!" allowed the
guide, who was even more alarmed, it seemed,
than Tubby himself, since the prospect of falling
into the hands of the dreaded Uhlan raiders
began to assume greater proportions, now that
the peril no longer lay in the dim distance, but
was close at hand.</p>

<p>"Then let's hurry and see what it looks like
under the bridge," advised Rob.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>Just as they figured, it proved easy enough to
lead their horses down the bank, which was covered
with grass and growing weeds, for since the
war began all really unnecessary work on roads
and railways had been stopped. And those horses
would have willingly gone anywhere if there only
seemed a prospect that they might rest a spell,
for they seemed tired all of the time.</p>

<p>"Listen to them shouting, will you?" Tubby
complained as they were going down amidst the
bushes that promised to screen them from the
party on the other side of the little stream across
which the massive bridge had been built.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they must have seen us," Merritt
said, "and that will mean they'll soon be across
the bridge again to find out what we're doing,
and who we are. What's the program, Rob?"</p>

<p>"We must act as though our only object in
coming down here was to water our horses," replied
the patrol leader; this idea having possibly
come into his mind as he noticed the way his
mount put its ears forward, and commenced to
whinny&mdash;as horses invariably do when they scent
water, and are thirsty.</p>

<p>"Come on, here, what's ailing you, Dobbin?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>demanded Tubby, jerking at the reins when his
animal displayed an inclination to hold back.</p>

<p>"He acts kind of queer, doesn't he?" Merritt
said when, after considerable fussing, Tubby
managed to coax his horse to once more advance,
though the animal seemed to be snorting, and
trembling. "If we were on the cattle range right
now I'd be half inclined to think he smelled a rattler
near by."</p>

<p>"My stars! I hope they don't have such pests
over here in Belgium!" exclaimed Tubby, beginning
to himself show immediate signs of nervousness.</p>

<p>"Not the least danger," declared Rob. "But,
all the same, my horse seems trying to hold back,
just as yours did, Tubby."</p>

<p>"They're sure a cantankerous lot all through!"
grumbled the fat scout, looking carefully where
he expected to plant his foot next; for, in spite
of Rob's assurance, he was not quite so certain
that the undergrowth beneath the bridge might
not harbor some poisonous reptile which might
strike unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"They're still keeping up that shouting!" an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>nounced
Merritt, listening. "Which I take it is
a queer thing for them to do. If they're German
raiders why don't they come across and interview
us, I wonder? I thought I saw uniforms
among the bunch. How about that, Rob?"</p>

<p>"The sun was in my eyes, and I couldn't say
for certain," acknowledged the one spoken to,
jerking at the bridle of his horse.</p>

<p>"One thing is sure," said Tubby, "the horses
are not at all thirsty; else there's some thing they
don't like about this place down here."</p>

<p>All of them were really puzzled by the strange
actions of their horses. It was no longer simply
Tubby's mount that acted so contrary, but the
other three also.</p>

<p>"Guess my nag got cold feet about something;
and it's catching as the measles," Tubby announced,
as he shook his head in the manner of
one who finds himself with too hard a nut to
crack.</p>

<p>"Well, that water looks cool and clear," said
Merritt, "and I think I could enjoy a few swallows
myself, if the horses won't."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sure it ain't poisoned, are you, Merritt?"
queried Tubby dubiously.</p>

<p>"Oh! get that crazy notion out of your poor
head, Tubby. Germans don't make war that way.
They face the music, and stand up before the
guns. What makes you look at me like that,
Rob?" and Merritt as he asked this question
stopped short, for he had been in the act of putting
his threat into deeds, and getting down beside
the stream to take a drink.</p>

<p>"I smell it too, Rob!" exclaimed Tubby just
then. "And, oh! let me tell you it's a rank odor.
Isn't it in this country they make all that Limburger
cheese; or over the border in Holland?
Well, if you asked me I'd say it was something
like that."</p>

<p>"Smells more like burnt powder to me!"
snapped Rob, showing visible signs of increasing
excitement.</p>

<p>With that he commenced looking hurriedly
around. Perhaps a sudden tremendous suspicion
may have flashed into his mind, and he was seeking
to justify it by making some sort of discovery.</p>

<p>The gully was of considerable width, as has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>been said before, though just at that time in
the late summer the stream that flowed through
it did not appear to be of any great depth, and
could be easily forded.</p>

<p>There were bushes and grass and weeds growing
all about, besides stray stones that may have
fallen there when the solid masonry of the really
fine bridge had been constructed years before.</p>

<p>Although he turned his eyes in this quarter and
that, Rob failed to see anything that looked at
all suspicious. Still that peculiar odor continued
to strike his sense of smell, stronger than before,
if anything.</p>

<p>"Must be something burning, fellows!" announced
Tubby, as he held a hand up so that he
could close his nose with thumb and finger
against the offensive odor.</p>

<p>The guide had meanwhile thrown himself
down at the brink of the stream and proceeded
to drink his fill. Evidently he had no fear concerning
the quality of the water. Typhoid germs
were unknown to his lexicon; and so long as
water looked fairly clear it suited him.</p>

<p>He was getting on his feet again as Tubby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>made that last remark. His horse had been pulling
more violently than ever at the rein, and the
Belgian started to say something uncomplimentary
to the animal in Flemish.</p>

<p>Rob had stopped examining the shore upon
which they were standing. He turned his gaze
across the stream to the opposite bank, for his
scout training told him that since the breeze
came from that quarter he would be apt to learn
the cause of the odor, so like burnt powder, if he
followed it up.</p>

<p>The others heard Rob give a half suppressed
shout, as though he had made a sudden and startling
discovery.</p>

<p>"Oh! what is it?" cried Tubby, straining to
keep his horse from trying to start up the ascent
again.</p>

<p>"Across the river, over there under the arch
of the bridge, don't you see that little curl of
blue-white rising?" exclaimed Rob. "Watch it
and you'll find that it is creeping along over the
ground. Come, we've got to get up out of this
in a hurry! Turn your horses, and let them help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>to drag you up! Quick, everybody; not a second
to lose, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Tubby no longer tried to hold his horse back;
on the contrary, he even urged the animal to
climb the grade in frantic haste. He did not
know what it all meant, but Rob acted as though
there must be some terrible danger threatening
them; and Tubby was no fool.</p>

<p>With cries and shouts they urged the animals
to ascend. Several times a horse would slip, and
come near falling headlong backward; then it
was the one who held the reins found it necessary
to encourage the struggling beast with word
and act, so that the horse might regain his footing.</p>

<p>Tubby, chancing to glimpse Rob's face about
the time they drew near the top was horrified to
see how very white it seemed. Then more than
ever did he realize that it must be something
dreadful that had threatened them.</p>

<p>"Rob, tell us what it was all about?" Tubby
managed to gasp, when, having reached the road
again, they were hurrying back as rapidly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>they could go, the horses helping to drag them
along.</p>

<p>"Just this," Rob told him briefly. "They've
fixed a mine there under the bridge, so as to blow
it up; and we've had the narrowest escape of our
lives!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>GETTING NEAR THE WAR ZONE.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Hold on to your horses, everybody!" called
out Merritt, as he looked back toward the bridge
from which they had now managed to press
quite a little distance.</p>

<p>Merritt somehow did not seem to be very much
astonished at what Rob had said. It might be he
himself had entertained suspicions along those
same lines.</p>

<p>They had heard that the determined Belgians
were engaged in throwing all the obstacles possible
in the way of an advance in force on the
part of the invaders. If only cavalry were to
be dealt with, the defenders of the soil had faith
in their ability to take care of all that could be
sent against them; but it was known to be a fact
that the artillery arm was what the Germans
meant to depend on more than anything else in
this war for conquest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>If bridges and culverts were destroyed in
every direction before the enemy could take possession
of the roads, it would be next to impossible
to move the great siege guns until some
sort of strong temporary structure had been built
in place of the stone and steel fabrics that were
blown up.</p>

<p>And so, for days, there had been reports drifting
in to Antwerp that certain bridges had been
marked for destruction. Those who sallied forth
in armored cars to speed over the country, and
play havoc with their Maxim guns, found it
necessary to revise their map of the district every
night so as to conform to the new changes that
had been wrought.</p>

<p>It was hardly ten seconds after Merritt told
them to keep a firm grip on the bridles of their
horses that the boys on looking back saw the
bridge suddenly rear itself in the air. Then came
a terrifying boom that made the very ground
under their feet quiver; and, in a moment later,
in place of the fine bridge lay a horrible gap,
from which smoke and dust was arising in sickening
clouds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>Tubby was as white as a sheet. The others
could hear the big sigh with which he drew in a
gulp of air.</p>

<p>"I want to say right here," he started to remark
solemnly, "that I'm thankful I've got such
a cracking good nose for queer odors. Think
what might have happened to us if I hadn't begun
to sniff around, and made Rob take notice. All
that pile of stuff would have buried us out of
sight. And the horses knew, sure they did. That
explains why they acted so funny all the while.
But isn't it a shame to see how they had to smash
that splendid bridge!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget that this is war, Tubby," Merritt
told him, "and to hinder the enemy from
coming up, anything is allowable."</p>

<p>"But that's going to block our going on, I take
it," ventured Tubby, watching Anthony, who
showed evidences of having been considerably
excited by the explosion, though Tubby could
not tell whether it was fear that influenced the
man, or an overmastering desire to join the army,
and engage in some of this obstructive work himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh! that doesn't follow," Rob assured him.
"I noticed that the river was shallow just now;
and I imagined I could see the old ford that used
to answer before this bridge was ever thought
of. We can get across without swimming. You
forded the Rio Grande once upon a time, Tubby,
and such a little bug stream as this shouldn't
phase you a bit."</p>

<p>"Oh! count on me going wherever the rest of
you lead," retorted Tubby, with a blustering air,
as though he did not want anyone to think him
at all timid.</p>

<p>"We might as well go back now," remarked
Rob, "and see about getting over. If the mine
has been exploded, there shouldn't be any danger;
I want to try that ford."</p>

<p>It was found that though the bridge was
wrecked pretty badly, the greatest damage was
to the span, and not so much to the anchorages
or piers. In time another arch could be built&mdash;should
peace ever come to this distracted land&mdash;when
men would be able to once more "beat their
swords into ploughshares," and start to rebuilding
what had been destroyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>"Follow after me," Rob told them, as he started
to urge his horse across where he could see
the old ford had been.</p>

<p>Little of the material from the wrecked bridge
had been thrown to any distance, so the ford was
not blocked. The horses still displayed more or
less restlessness, as though they could not understand
that, with such a smell of choking gases
in the air, the danger was all over. The three
boys, however, had had considerable experience
in handling balky animals, and knew just how to
urge them on.</p>

<p>Once on the other side, they started up the
bank. As they arrived at the road, having crossed
the abyss, they saw a crowd of men hurrying
toward the spot. They were partly Belgian soldiers,
it turned out, along with some civilians,
possibly men versed in explosives or strategy to
be employed to delay the advance of the German
artillery.</p>

<p>Of course, they were very much excited at
meeting the boys. The khaki uniforms seemed to
soften their anger to some extent, but one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>appeared to be in authority started to scold them
for walking so blindly into a trap.</p>

<p>Through the guide Rob hastened to explain
how it came they had not suspected the truth.
Then as questions began to follow, he also told
who and what they were, even mentioning something
concerning their self-imposed mission into
the danger zone of the fighting.</p>

<p>When the precious passport, written out by
the good burgomaster, was shown, it had an additional
soothing effect. The man in charge of
the squad of destruction smiled and nodded as
he perused the document, written in French.</p>

<p>"He say burgomaster his uncle!" explained Antonio,
after the other had handed the paper back,
and made some remark.</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's what I call fine. Tell him
we're glad we got out from under that bridge in
time," said Rob, "and also that we think he made
a clean sweep of the job."</p>

<p>This seemed to please the Belgian officer, for
he insisted on shaking hands all around. Feeling
that they were now free to proceed, the scouts
resumed their journey along the road that led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>to Brussels; probably, wholly in the hands of the
invaders further on toward the capital, since
rumor had it that immense numbers of German
troops were daily being moved toward Ghent.</p>

<p>"All of which only goes to show how necessary
it is to be constantly on the watch while
you're in a country that's fighting for its life,"
Merritt remarked to his companions as they lost
sight of the ruined bridge.</p>

<p>"If only we had eyes in the back of our heads,
we might get along a heap better, I think,"
grumbled Tubby, as his horse awkwardly stumbled
over some small object, and gave him a
shock.</p>

<p>"It was a close call, all right," acknowledged
Merritt, "and has sobered our guide a whole lot,
I notice. He listens to every far-off boom now,
as though something might be drawing him. But
the morning is wearing away, so I suggest that
we stop at the very first village we come to, and
see if we can beg, buy, or steal something to eat.
I'm hungry as a bear."</p>

<p>"Oh! bless you, Merritt, for those kind words!"
called out Tubby. "I've felt a vacuum down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>around my belt line for two hours back. Whoa!
there!" he added, as his horse stumbled again.
"Want to break my neck, you animated skeleton?
He knocks his hoofs together every third step
he takes. No wonder they didn't grab him for
the cavalry; he'd have fallen all over himself in
the first charge."</p>

<p>Coming to a little hamlet, the boys found a
house where they could secure something in the
way of a lunch. Even at this early stage in the
war, however, prudent hotel keepers realized that
times were going to be hard, and that it would
be the part of wisdom to conceal all the stores
possible against a rainy day, or the raids of
such invaders who might be billeted upon the villagers.</p>

<p>Here the boys remained between one and two
hours, since the day was unusually hot, and their
mounts were not in the best of condition for
standing hard service.</p>

<p>Some of the good people had left for safer
quarters, which would mean Antwerp, of course,&mdash;deemed
impossible of capture at that day on
account of its wonderful defenses. A group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>gathered in front of the little hotel, and questioned
Anthony as to who the three boys in the
uniform of scouts might be, and of the nature of
their mission that tempted them to invade a region
being made desolate by war.</p>

<p>Anthony himself knew very little on that score;
but since it would not look well for him to admit
this fact, it is possible he "drew the long
bow" to some extent. He may even have told
all sorts of fairy stories about the boys being
English agents sent over to learn facts in connection
with the movements of the German army,
so that a strong force of the allies from across
the Channel could be hastily dispatched to the
scene, and chase the haughty Germans back
across the Rhine.</p>

<p>Some idea like this the boys found very prevalent
all through their journey. The Belgians
seemed to believe the English were getting a wonderful
surprise ready with which to stagger the
enemy. If they could have only known how an
army had to be built up step by step in the great
island country, they might have felt less confi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>dence,
and perhaps shown more discretion in attacking
the invaders.</p>

<p>Rob suspected something of this sort when he
saw the way the villagers observed him and two
chums, staring at them as though they were curiosities.</p>

<p>"Makes you feel like some punkins, to have
all these people watch every little thing you do,
and get out of your way so quick when you go
to make a move, don't it?" remarked Tubby, evidently
tickled over the attention shown them.</p>

<p>"I don't just like it, to tell you the truth," admitted
Merritt.</p>

<p>"Oh! you're too modest by half, Merritt!"
jeered the fat scout.</p>

<p>"It isn't that, Tubby," explained the other.
"Rob here says he believes our guide is spreading
the report that we're English messengers, sent
ahead to pick up news about the Germans, so they
can be smashed when the British army gets here."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" demanded his friend.
"It isn't so <i>very</i> dreadful that I can see, to be
mistaken for a Johnny Bull."</p>

<p>"You'll change your tune, my boy," Rob told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>him, "if the Germans should come along and
nab us. We'll soon see how you begin to roar
out that you're a Yankee, as true-blue as they
make them."</p>

<p>"Oh! but they wouldn't know anything about
that!" declared Tubby, though showing signs of
increasing dismay at the same time.</p>

<p>"You never can tell," he was told by Rob.
"The ways of these smart Germans are past finding
out. They've got spies everywhere. Right
now there may be some secret sympathizer with
the Fatherland in that bunch close by, taking in
all that silly Anthony has been saying."</p>

<p>"Gingersnaps and popguns!" gasped Tubby,
"if that's really so I guess we'd better muzzle
our guide in a hurry. Where's he gone to, do
you think, Rob? It was all of half an hour ago
that I saw him last, talking to the crowd."</p>

<p>"I was wondering about that myself," said
Merritt. "If we expect to be getting along about
this time, we ought to look Anthony up."</p>

<p>"You take a turn that way, and I'll step into
the taproom of the inn, to see if he is there," remarked
Rob, who had a slight frown on his face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>as he spoke, as if he might not be wholly satisfied
with the way in which their guide was acting.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Rob and Merritt joined
Tubby at the same time.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing in my section," remarked Merritt,
"except that I'm afraid somebody has swiped
one of our nags, for I could only count three
horses hitched there."</p>

<p>"Then, that settles it!" said Rob positively.</p>

<p>"Settles what?" piped up Tubby.</p>

<p>"Anthony has basely deserted us, and taken
to the back road!" Rob told them. "I feared as
much from what the little inn proprietor let
out; but what you say clinches the thing. Our
guide is a mile or more on the way back to Antwerp
by now!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE DESERTION OF ANTHONY.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"The miserable hound! Hanging would be too
good for him!" exclaimed Merritt, who it appeared
had not up to that instant suspected anything
like the truth, and was therefore taken completely
by surprise.</p>

<p>"That all depends on what his motive may have
been," said Rob reflectively.</p>

<p>"Why, it's plain he got cold feet after that little
experience at the bridge this morning!" Merritt
hastened to declare. "I thought he was a
man of more nerve than that. I hope all Belgians
are not made of the same kind of stuff."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Merritt," Rob cautioned
him, "you are jumping to conclusions now without
being sure of your ground. I've been watching
Anthony from time to time and I've noticed
that whenever he happened to speak of the gallant
doings of his people on the battlefields his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>face would beam with pride, and what I took
to be a touch of envy."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Tubby, grasping the idea, "then,
Rob, you think our guide shook us just because
he couldn't hold back any longer. He thought
he ought to be on the firing line along with the
rest, and get in a crack at the invaders of his
country. Is that the stuff, Rob?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that way," Rob informed him
gravely, "but we've got no time to look Anthony
up. Whether he's gone to join the Belgian army
or turned back to the city of Antwerp isn't going
to cut any figure in our calculations."</p>

<p>"That's about the size of it, Rob," agreed Merritt,
beginning to show signs of returning confidence,
when the patrol leader spoke with such
vim.</p>

<p>"What we've got to do is to figure out whether
we want to call the whole thing off just because
we haven't a guide to do the talking business
for us and turn back to the city, or set our teeth
together and push on."</p>

<p>Tubby and Merritt exchanged looks.</p>

<p>The latter even half opened his mouth as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>to indignantly protest against giving up the most
cherished plan of his life for a little snag, such
as the desertion of Anthony proved. Then he
suddenly closed his lips firmly. He had remembered
an important fact, which was that after
all he should not be the one to make such a suggestion.
Let one of these good chums, who were
his side partners, express an opinion first of all.
That was why Merritt remained silent.</p>

<p>"Oh! we just can't quit at the first puff!" remonstrated
Tubby. "Fellows who have been
through all we have shouldn't be built that way.
Think of the battles we've been up against on
the diamond and the gridiron; and did anybody
ever hear us complain, or show a yellow streak?
Well, I guess not! Tell him how you feel about
it, Rob!"</p>

<p>"Just as you do, Tubby," responded the scout
leader heartily. "I wasn't counting any too much
on Anthony's services, come to speak of it. Nine-tenths
of what we expected to accomplish would
have to come from our own hard work. If you
put it up to me to decide, I say every time, go
ahead!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>Merritt looked almost joyous. Though he was
not a demonstrative fellow as a rule, he could not
help reaching out and squeezing a hand of each
of his faithful chums. Indeed, no one ever knew
more reliable allies than Merritt possessed in Rob
and Tubby, who were ready to go through fire
and water with him, if necessary.</p>

<p>"It may all turn out for the best," Tubby continued,
with fine optimism, such as these chubby
fellows nearly always show since life looks rosy
to them. "And it's going to save you a little
money in the bargain, too, Merritt. I must brush
up my French and Flemish from now on. Already
I can say as many as six words of the
first, and I think I know how to almost pronounce
one in Flemish."</p>

<p>"No trouble to tell what that one is," remarked
Rob, laughing.</p>

<p>"It stands for grub!" added Merritt.</p>

<p>"Now, I consider it strange how you should
guess so easily," Tubby shot back at them reproachfully.
"I suppose I'll have to acknowledge
the corn. We've got to eat to live, and so I
thought I ought to know the right word that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>would produce results quickest. Don't blame me,
boys; I was thinking of you as well as myself."</p>

<p>"Well, shall we get out of here?" asked Rob.
"I don't altogether like the way we are being
stared at by some of the people of the village.
They say in Antwerp that there's a hidden sympathizer
of the Germans in every city, town and
hamlet through the whole of Belgium always
trying to send information of value to the enemy."</p>

<p>"Huh! don't know just what to believe, and
what to brand as big yarns," protested Tubby.
"Since we've landed here I've heard stories that
would make poor old Baron Munchausen hide his
head in shame as a has-been. If one-tenth of
the same turned out to be true, these Germans
are the most remarkable people that ever lived
for getting ready for a war against the whole
world forty years ahead of the date. I'm beginning
to use my own horse-sense, and figure things
out."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they turned their backs on
the little hamlet where a fair meal had been pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>cured,
and which had also witnessed their first
real misfortune in the base desertion of Anthony.</p>

<p>In many cases they found the roads occupied
with throngs of fugitives. These poor peasants
were flocking, in a general way, toward Antwerp,
though possibly a few of them meant to
cross the line into the Netherlands, where they
hoped to be safe from the German armies of
invasion that were gradually progressing further
and further toward the coast.</p>

<p>A thousand-and-one sights greeted the eyes of
the three scouts. More than a few times they
stopped for some purpose or other that did their
hearts credit. Once it was a limping boy whose
condition excited the pity of Rob. He did not
hesitate to put to some use the practical knowledge
of surgery that he had picked up in company
with all the other members of the Eagle
Patrol.</p>

<p>Another time they saw a wretched woman trying
to mend the wheel of a miserable old handcart,
upon which she had some humble belongings,
and three small children. That was more
than the boys could stand. They stopped their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>horses, and giving the lines of their mounts into
the keeping of Tubby, Rob and Merritt busied
themselves with fixing up the disabled wheel.</p>

<p>Although they had next to no tools with which
to work, their skill proved sufficient to surmount
the difficulty. Inside of twenty minutes the
woman was able to trudge along again. She
thanked them volubly in Flemish, which they
did not understand. Tubby listened eagerly, but
owned up that it was beyond the range of his
extremely limited vocabulary, consisting, as that
did, of but one word.</p>

<p>"Well, that look on her face paid us for all
our trouble," Rob remarked contentedly, as he
once more remounted, and led the way along the
highway.</p>

<p>"It's something fierce where all these forlorn
people come from," said Tubby.</p>

<p>"To me the greatest puzzle is where they're all
going," Merritt added.</p>

<p>"If you should ask them," Rob advanced as his
opinion, "nine out of ten couldn't begin to tell
you. Some have had their houses burned over
their heads; others I expect have seen their homes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>destroyed by bursting shells, where they happened
to lie near the place where an artillery
duel was going on. So they've just started on
the road, hoping to reach <i>somewhere</i> the fighting
won't follow."</p>

<p>"It's a terrible sight," sighed Tubby. "I'll
never forget it as long as I live. Every minute
I'm telling myself we ought to be the happiest
people going over in America, to know that we
needn't get mixed up in all this butcher business."</p>

<p>Slowly the afternoon wore away. The three
chums did not make very rapid progress, and
for many reasons. In the first place their horses
objected to putting forth any unusual exertion,
and seemed to consider that they were doing their
full duty by merely working their four weary
legs in a machine-like fashion.</p>

<p>Then, again, the roads were cluttered in places
with squads of the peasant population fleeing
from the battle lines. Three times did the scouts
come upon detachments of Belgian soldiers stationed
behind temporary intrenchments, where
they expected to harass the advance forces of
the Germans whenever they appeared.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>From these men they received many curious
stares. Of course the soldiers could not understand
why three boys in khaki, who were undoubtedly
not Belgian scouts, should be heading
so boldly toward the scene of carnage, when
everybody else was fleeing madly the other way.</p>

<p>They were halted and questioned. At first Rob
felt a qualm of anxiety, lest the fact that they
no longer had an interpreter in their company
to explain things might get them into trouble.
That fear soon vanished, however. In every instance
it was found that some man could either
talk fair English, or else what little French the
patrol leader was able to muster explained matters
in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The probability was that the message given
them by the burgomaster of Antwerp was much
more potent than anything else. The worthy official
was a well known and highly respected man;
and among these commands there were always
those who knew him personally, so that his "passport,"
while hardly worth the paper upon which
it was written, officially, acted magically with the
Belgian officers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>As the afternoon sun began to draw near the
western horizon they continued to be on the lookout
for some haven of refuge. Another night
was coming; they must not only have food but
lodging, if this latter could possibly be obtained.</p>

<p>"Of course," explained Rob, as they walked
their sorry looking horses on, "while we'd like to
find some sort of respectable beds to-night, if
the worst comes, we can always make shift with
a haystack. It wouldn't be the first time we've
curled up in the hay and snatched a few winks
of sleep."</p>

<p>"I should say not," Tubby assured him. "Only
I do hope we manage to strike a dinner-call somehow
or other. I can do without a bed, but I must
have eats or I'll collapse utterly, like a balloon
with the gas let out."</p>

<p>"Please don't think of it, Tubby," Merritt implored
him. "We promise to do everything in
our power to find the grub. Brace up! We're
coming to a village; and I think I can see an
inn the first thing."</p>

<p>It proved to be as Merritt had said, and better
still, the man who kept the modest little tavern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>assured Rob in fair English that he would be
proud to serve the honored guests; also that he
had once spent a year in the Birmingham machine
shops himself.</p>

<p>"Just like all the rest, he takes us for Johnny
Bulls," complained Tubby.</p>

<p>"Well, that's partly your fault," Rob told him.</p>

<p>"Just because I'm so well filled out, I suppose
you mean, Rob? Well, if they keep on thinking
that, I guess I'll have to get busy and cultivate
a real cockney accent. 'Beg pawdon; thank <i>you</i>;
my word!' You see I've got a few of their favorite
jabs spotted."</p>

<p>As before, they found themselves the object
of more attention than any of them enjoyed.
People kept peeping in through the open door of
the room where the three strange young chaps
in khaki were enjoying their really excellent supper.</p>

<p>"Don't mind them," advised Rob, when he saw
that Tubby was posing, as if conscious of being
in the lime-light. "Let's finish our supper, and
then we can sit outside on the porch as the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>goes down, and talk over our plans for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Merritt quickly, "because to-morrow
may take us so far on our journey that
we'll either find our man, or meet with some bitter
disappointment, something I hate to think
about."</p>

<p>"Don't do it, then," advised Rob. "We must
believe everything is bound to come out right,
and that you'll not only run across Steven Meredith,
but that the paper will be found under the
lining of the cover to his field-glass case, where
he's been carrying it all this while, without knowing
it."</p>

<p>"One thing sure," said Merritt grimly, "if he's
left that post and gone anywhere else, I'll follow
him, hit or miss, if it takes me to the battle
front."</p>

<p>"Listen!" exclaimed Tubby. "What's that man
shouting, Rob?"</p>

<p>"As near as I can make out," replied Rob quickly,
"he says the Uhlans are entering at one end
of the town."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>WHEN THE UHLANS CAME.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>When Rob Blake made this startling explanation
of the loud cries from without, his two companions
started up from the table in dismay.
They could easily understand that the coming
of the German cavalrymen just then threatened
them with unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>If they were mistaken for English boys they
might expect not only rough treatment, but possibly
find themselves railroaded into Germany,
with one of those terrible dungeons in a Rhine
fortress as their destination.</p>

<p>Perhaps even Tubby began to deplore the fact
that he chanced to be wearing a Boy Scout khaki
suit, and a campaign hat besides; with the leggings
that scouts in the States have adopted instead
of the woolen stockings used by other
branches of the organization abroad.</p>

<p>If pride must have a fall, Tubby began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>experience the first twinges of regret at that moment
as he scrambled to his feet, and waited to
hear what Rob or Merritt would say.</p>

<p>"It may be only a false alarm," Merritt suggested.
"These poor people have been seeing
imaginary regiments of Uhlans ever since war
was declared."</p>

<p>"But they're making oodles of noise, anyhow!"
Tubby protested.</p>

<p>"We can soon find out if it's so," said Rob,
hurrying over to one of the windows, which were
partly screened with flimsy curtains, through
which any person from the inside could look out,
but which would prevent scrutiny from the village
street, except when the lamps were lighted
later.</p>

<p>They quickly saw that their worst fears were
realized. Down the street at least fifty horsemen
were riding. The fact that they carried
lances and wore the customary spiked helmets of
the German troopers told Rob as well as words
could have done that at last they were gazing on
the far-famed Uhlans.</p>

<p>They were not at all the fierce-appearing war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>riors
the boys may have pictured them, having
the Russian Cossacks in mind at the time. Indeed,
a number seemed to be laughing heartily,
doubtless on account of the evident terror their
presence had apparently inspired in the breasts
of the villagers. And some of them were rosy-cheeked
young fellows, who, shorn of their military
accouterments, would have struck the scouts
as good-natured German youths.</p>

<p>Others, however, were more grim and haughty,
as though they thought it their duty to impress
these stubborn Belgians with a due sense of their
importance as factors to be dealt with.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling sight to see those hard-riding
soldiers of the Kaiser coming along the village
street, with people staring at them from open
doors and windows, yet none daring to utter a
word of protest. Fear was written largely on
nearly every face, though doubtless there were
also those who viewed the coming of the hated
Uhlans with illy suppressed rage. Perhaps they
had lost some dear one during the battles that
had already been fought around Liège and other
places; or in the destruction of Louvain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>"Rob, don't you see they're heading right this
way?" whispered Tubby suddenly, after they had
watched the stirring picture for a minute or so.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a fact," replied Rob. "Let's hope
they mean to only ride through the village, and
leave by the other side."</p>

<p>"Gee! I hope now they won't fall in love with
our horses, and run them off!" ventured Tubby,
excited by his fears in that respect; for Tubby
did not like to walk any more than he could possibly
help.</p>

<p>"Not much danger in that line," scoffed Merritt.
"But look at that officer in front of the
column&mdash;he's pointing right this way, you notice,
Rob, and is saying something to another
rider close behind him."</p>

<p>"Oh! can he have seen us?" wailed Tubby, no
doubt having very positive visions of prison life
before him just then, with solitary confinement
on a diet of bread and water, which was the
worst punishment he could imagine.</p>

<p>"That's impossible," Rob instantly assured
him. "The chances are he's discovered this inn,
and is telling the other officer they may be able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>to secure something to eat, and a bottle of wine
here. Their men can pick up supper through the
place, making the poor people furnish the meal,
or have their houses knocked about their ears."</p>

<p>"But if they come in here do we want to stay
and be arrested for English spies?" asked Merritt;
whereat Tubby's lips could be seen to move,
although no words came forth, while he anxiously
waited for Rob to decide.</p>

<p>The other had already made up his mind.</p>

<p>"That would be foolish on our part," he told
Merritt, "and unnecessary in the bargain. They
may only stop for five minutes to drink wine,
and then go on again, because they know they're
in the enemy's country here. We must find a
place to hide till they leave. Come along with
me, fellows."</p>

<p>Now it happened that Rob had never forgotten
one of the things all scouts are enjoined to impress
upon their minds; which is to observe the
most minute detail wherever they happen to be.
In the woods this faculty for observation had
often served the patrol leader a good turn, and
the same thing happened now.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>While sitting there and enjoying the warm supper
which the keeper of the village inn had spread
before them, Rob had taken note of his surroundings.
Thus he knew just where the stairs leading
to the upper <i>etage</i> or floor of the inn was located;
and also that it could not be easily seen
from the door leading to the street.</p>

<p>He led Tubby and Merritt over to the stairs.</p>

<p>"We'll slip up here," he told them, for a quick
glance around had assured Rob that no one was
watching them.</p>

<p>Most of those who had been around the tavern
hurried outside at the first sign of alarm, and
were now gaping at the coming troop. The proprietor,
guessing that his establishment would
be the first object of attention on the part of
the invading enemy, was wildly striving to conceal
certain valuables he possessed under a board in
the floor, where, perhaps, he also kept his choicest
wines.</p>

<p>Once the scouts had climbed aloft they managed
to gain a sort of garret where broken furniture
and hair-covered trunks seemed to be
stored.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>"This will answer us as well as any other
place," Rob told them, as he closed the door, and
managed to push a heavy trunk against it.</p>

<p>"And there are two little peephole windows,
too, for all the world like eye-glasses, but big
enough for us to see through," Tubby remarked,
groping his way among the collection of riffraff
with which the garret was encumbered, until he
found himself able to kneel and look through the
dusty glass of a window.</p>

<p>"They're spreading all over the place," he immediately
announced, "and making the village
people get supper ready for them. Chances are,
too, they won't whack up a red cent for all they
eat and drink. Whee! so this is war, is it? Well,
all I can say is it's a mighty mean game."</p>

<p>"Some of them have come into the inn," ventured
Merritt. "I can hear heavy voices below
us, German voices, too. You know sound travels
up walls like everything. And there's a heap of
bustle going on below, as if the landlord, his wife
and everybody else might be on the jump to wait
on the Uhlan guests."</p>

<p>"Can you blame them?" said Tubby, "when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>like as not if they said no they'd find a torch
put to their house? Rob, you don't think they'll
come up here, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! hardly, unless they take to ransacking
the house for valuables, or more wine. They
must know time is too valuable for that, because
there are Belgian forces all around this place
who might drop in on them. No, they'll get a
hurried bite and then be off again."</p>

<p>For some little time they continued to listen
to the confused sounds that came to their ears.
Considerable shouting from the street testified
to the fact that some of the soldiers might be acting,
as Tubby expressed it, "rough-house"; and
although the light outside was commencing to
grow rather dim, looking through the window
they saw several instances where a soldier struck
some half grown boy who may have acted in a
sullen fashion, or declined to do what he was
told.</p>

<p>All at once there was a shot!</p>

<p>This was followed by a great outcry, in which
loud German voices could be heard giving orders.
A scrambling downstairs announced that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>the officers who had been eating at the inn were
hurriedly rejoining their command.</p>

<p>"Are the Belgian troops coming, Rob?" asked
Tubby, finding it impossible to see what was going
on, because he had been unable to open his
window, as the others had done.</p>

<p>"No, it must have been some desperate villager
sniping from a house," replied Rob; and
a minute later he continued hastily: "Yes, they're
carrying a Uhlan to his horse, and threatening
the people with guns and lances."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope now they don't start in to shooting
the poor things down!" cried the sympathetic
Tubby, wringing his hands, though hardly conscious
of what he was doing.</p>

<p>"They've rushed into the house next to this,"
Merritt now exclaimed, "and seem to be searching
it, which tells me the party who fired, man
or boy, must have been concealed there!"</p>

<p>"Gee! that's getting pretty near home!" muttered
Tubby.</p>

<p>"Rob, did you see that puff of smoke coming
out of the house then?" Merritt presently demanded,
almost bursting with the excitement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, I'm sorry to say I do see it," replied
the leader of the Eagle Patrol, as he continued
to look downward. "They've set fire to
the building; and what bothers me most of all is
the wind coming straight this way. I'm afraid
it means the inn will take fire too, and like as not
be burned to the ground!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>WITH FIRE AND SMOKE.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Gingersnaps and popguns! then we're in for
a warm time of it!" Tubby burst out.</p>

<p>"Let's hope they manage to get the fire out;
or that it doesn't spread to the inn," Merritt
soothed him, after the manner of one who wished
to throw oil on troubled waters.</p>

<p>"If only the Germans would pull out right
away we could get down from here in good time,"
continued Tubby hopefully. "Look again, fellows,
and see if they show any signs of skipping."</p>

<p>"They seem to be galloping all over the village,
as far as I can see, and threatening to shoot
if anybody dares take a crack at them," Rob announced,
after making a hurried survey.</p>

<p>"Oh! my stars!" groaned Tubby, "little did I
ever dream that I'd stand a chance of being
cooked before I'd been in Belgium two days. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>always said I liked cold weather best, and now
I know it. Baked or stewed or even broiled
doesn't suit my taste."</p>

<p>"The fire next door is beginning to rage fiercely,"
remarked Rob. "The people are just standing
on, and sullenly watching it burn. They
don't seem to dare to offer to help save a single
thing, because they might be shot down."</p>

<p>"That house is doomed!" asserted Merritt,
gloomily.</p>

<p>"Better keep back more," cautioned Rob. "The
light grows stronger all the while, you notice,
and we might be seen up here by some Uhlan,
who'd think it fine sport to send a shot if only to
frighten us. I thought I saw one man glance
up. If he happened to see that we wore khaki
and had on these military looking hats he'd pass
the word along that there were Belgian soldiers
hiding in the inn."</p>

<p>"Please don't start a riot," begged Tubby. "It's
sure bad enough as it stands without that happening.
If we had wings now we might sail
away. What wouldn't I give for an aëroplane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>to come along at this minute, and pick me up?
Rob, has our house taken fire yet?"</p>

<p>At first Rob did not see fit to answer, upon
which the suspicious Tubby pressed him to declare
the truth.</p>

<p>"No matter how bad it is," he said soberly,
"we should know the worst, instead of pulling
the wool over our own eyes, and believing everything's
lovely. How about it, Rob?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's a bad job, Tubby."</p>

<p>"You mean we're on fire, do you?" questioned
the other, with a hurried intake of his breath, as
his heart possibly beat tumultuously with new
apprehension.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's caught the end of the inn, and with
that breeze blowing there isn't a chance for this
house to be saved," Rob continued. "I'm sorry
for the poor man who owns it; but then he'll be
no worse off than tens of thousands of other
Belgian sufferers."</p>

<p>"But think of us, will you?" the fat scout
urged. "We're neutrals only, and it's a shame
to make us stand for that foolish shot some sniping
boy may have fired. Hadn't we better make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>our way downstairs, Rob, and throw ourselves
on the mercy of the Uhlans?"</p>

<p>"I'm in favor of sticking it out just as long
as we can," said Merritt desperately; for only too
well did he know that once they fell into the hands
of the Germans, all chances of carrying out his
well laid plans would be lost.</p>

<p>"Oh! so am I, when it comes to that," affirmed
Tubby; "and I hope that neither of you think
I'd be the one to scream before I'm hurt. But
I do smell smoke, and that looks bad, as the
plight of Bluebeard's wife."</p>

<p>There could be no questioning that what Tubby
said was so, for little spirals of penetrating smoke
had commenced to come under the door, so that
they could already feel their eyes begin to smart.</p>

<p>Rob went back to the open window to watch.
He knew that the thing calculated to help them
most of all would be the flitting of the Uhlan
troop. If the raiders would only gallop away
from town there would be an opportunity for
the three Boy Scouts to make their way from
the garret of the doomed inn.</p>

<p>"Are they showing any signs of going yet?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>asked Tubby, rubbing one hand continually over
the other; and then he burst out into a half hysterical
fit of laughter as he went on to add: "D'ye
know, when I said that it made me think of Bluebeard,
don't you remember where the wife was
waiting to be called down to lose her head, and
expected her brothers to come to the rescue, she
had her sister watching out of the window for
a cloud of dust on the road? And all the while
she keeps on asking: 'Sister Ann, Sister Ann,
do you see anyone coming?'"</p>

<p>"I guess you're not as badly rattled as you
make out, Tubby," suggested Merritt, "when you
can joke like that with the house on fire. In this
case you're wanting to know whether there's
anybody going. Well, they're here yet, I'm sorry
to tell you."</p>

<p>"But I think they are getting together to ride
away," Rob added.</p>

<p>"Did they shoot down many of the poor villagers
on account of that sniper?" asked the fat
scout anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't see anything like that," Rob
hastened to assure him. "There was some firing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>but it looked to me as if it might be done for effect,
just like cowpunchers ride into town, yelling,
and shooting their guns in the air. But at the
same time I think they must have got the person
who did the sniping."</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard several shots that seemed to
come from inside that next house," Merritt admitted.
"It'll certainly be his funeral pyre. The
house is all aflame, and burning fiercely."</p>

<p>"Poor chap! he must have been crazy to fire
on Uhlans when they were in such force," Tubby
declared. "They never refuse a dare, I've heard
said. And believe me, I don't ever want to test
them. I hope they hear the call soon now. That
fire must be getting pretty close to us by this
time, boys!"</p>

<p>Rob opened the door of the garret a trifle,
after having pushed back the heavy trunk. Immediately
a cloud of smoke entered, at which
poor Tubby fell back in dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh! we're goners, I'm afraid!" he moaned,
making his way through the pall in the direction
of the one small window that was open, so that
he might secure a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>"If we can keep the smoke out a little while
longer it's going to be all right," Rob informed
them. "The Uhlans are all in the saddle, and
seem to be only waiting for the order to leave.
I can hear the captain in charge of the troop
telling the villagers something or other, and he is
speaking in French, too; so I reckon it must be
a warning that if a single shot is fired as they
ride away, they will turn back and not leave one
stone unturned in the place."</p>

<p>"That seems to be the usual Uhlan way, I've
heard," muttered Tubby, glad he could say anything;
for at the time he was desperately clutching
his nose with thumb and fingers, as though
in hopes of keeping the pungent smoke from entering
his lungs.</p>

<p>He had apparently gotten beyond the seeing
stage, for both his eyes were kept tightly closed.
At the same time Tubby was listening eagerly
for good tidings. He knew that his chums were
constantly on the lookout.</p>

<p>"There they go off!" he heard Rob say presently,
when the situation had almost become unbearable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>The sound of many hoofs coming to their ears,
even above the roaring of the fire, affirmed this
statement. Tubby acted as though he wanted to
cheer, and then reconsidered his intention,
through fear that the sound might be heard by
the Uhlans, and work them harm.</p>

<p>"Now, let's get out of here," said Rob briskly.
"Take hold of my coat, Tubby. Merritt, bring
up the rear. We'll find a room just below this
where we can drop out of a window easily, if
the stairs are ablaze, as I'm afraid may be the
case."</p>

<p>Passing down from the garret in this fashion,
through dense billows of smoke that struck terror
to the soul of Tubby, they presently found themselves
in one of the ordinary rooms, used perhaps
for stray guests.</p>

<p>Looking from the window Rob saw that it
would be easy for him and Merritt to drop down
on the turf below. Tubby must be taken care of
first, and so Rob snatched a sheet off a bed, and
twisted it into the shape of a rope.</p>

<p>This he forced Tubby to take hold of, and then
climb over the window sill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>"Keep a fast grip, and we'll lower you!" Rob
told the fat scout, who had full confidence in his
comrades since they had never failed him.</p>

<p>After all, it was an easy thing to let him down,
because the distance was short. As for themselves,
the other two boys scorned to make use
of such means. Clambering out of the window,
when Tubby reported himself safe below, they
hung down as far as they were able, and then
just let go. There was a little jar as they struck
solid ground, and it was all over.</p>

<p>"Beautifully done, fellows," Tubby was saying,
as he dug his fat knuckles into his still smarting
eyes. "We'd pass muster for fire laddies, I
tell you. After all, it takes scouts to know what
ought to be done. But I think some of these people
must have gone out of their minds to whoop
it up so. What's that poor woman shouting now,
Rob? Can you make it out? And look how
they're holding her back, would you? It must
be the wife of the inn keeper; the loss of her
home has unsettled her reason, I'm afraid, poor
thing!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>But Rob, who had been listening, knew better,
as he immediately proved.</p>

<p>"It's a whole lot worse than that, I'm afraid,"
he told the others. "She keeps calling out for
her baby; and I think the child's been left in the
burning building!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE DUTY OF A SCOUT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Tubby was dreadfully shocked when he heard
the news.</p>

<p>"The poor thing!" he cried, "to be forgotten in
all the row, and left to be smothered by the smoke,
perhaps burned up in the bargain. Oh! Rob, I
hope you're mistaken!"</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe so myself, Tubby, but
if you look you can see them all staring up there
at that window next to the one we jumped from.
Some even point at it, and you notice more than
a few of the women are crying like everything."</p>

<p>"But my stars! why doesn't somebody run up
and get the child out, if that's so?" Tubby demanded,&mdash;forgetting
that his eyes still smarted,&mdash;because
this discovery, and the distress of the
parents overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"Because the lower floor is all afire, and the
stairs can't be used," Merritt told him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>"If only we'd known about the child before
we came out, we might have saved it," Tubby
wailed. "If I could climb like some fellows I
know, who can even go up a greased pole in
the contests, I'd be for making my way up there
right now. Hey! what are you going to do, Rob,
Merritt? Let me help any way I can. Stand
on my back if you want to; it's broad enough to
do for a foundation! The poor little thing! We
mustn't let it be burned if we can help it!"</p>

<p>Neither Rob nor Merritt had waited to give
Tubby any answer when he made that really generous
offer. They knew there would be no need
of his back as a means for elevating one of them
to the sill of the upper window. In fact, Rob
had made a sudden discovery that must have been
the main reason for his speedy actions.</p>

<p>"The tree is close to the house, Merritt!" he
was saying as he sprang forward.</p>

<p>"Better still, Rob, one limb grows right alongside
the window!" the other scout added, keeping
in touch with the patrol leader.</p>

<p>They were quickly on the spot, Rob starting up
the trunk of the tree at once.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't follow me," he told his chum, as he
climbed upward. "If I find the child I may want
to drop it down to you. Get busy underneath,
Merritt!"</p>

<p>"All right, Rob; I understand!" came the answer.</p>

<p>Tubby had also heard what was said. He came
puffing forward, as though he did not mean to be
left out entirely of the rescue.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, Merritt," he was saying,
between his pants from his recent exertions.</p>

<p>"Sure I will, if there's any chance, Tubby."</p>

<p>"Can Rob reach that window from the limb?"
the fat scout asked anxiously, as he tried to look
straight upward, a task that was always a trying
one with Tubby because of the odd shape of
his chubby neck.</p>

<p>"He's about there now, you notice. There's
something of a little ledge underneath and he's
going to make it all right."</p>

<p>"There! He's clinging outside and starting
to throw a leg over," Tubby exclaimed in evident
rapture. "And if there is a child inside that
room, our chum will find it. If it was me now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>I'd be so blind with the smoke I'd have to just
grope my way around, and p'raps get lost in the
shuffle."</p>

<p>"But what's that you've got in your hand,
Tubby?" pursued Merritt, becoming aware for
the first time that the other was holding on to
some white object.</p>

<p>"This? Why, what but that fine sheet you
used to lower me with," he was told.</p>

<p>"I remember that Rob dropped it down after
you landed," said Merritt, "but I never thought
you'd want to take it along with you, Tubby."</p>

<p>"Oh! shucks! don't you see, I picked it up when
I started over after you," the stout boy tried to
explain.</p>

<p>"But why should you do that?" persisted Merritt,
who was looking eagerly aloft just then,
and possibly not fully paying heed to what he
was saying.</p>

<p>"Why, you know how firemen stand and hold
a blanket for people to jump into?" explained
Tubby; "I thought that if it came to the worst,
Rob might drop the baby into this sheet, which
both of us could hold stretched out!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, you <i>are</i> a daisy, after all, Tubby!" cried
Merritt, in sincere admiration. "That's as clever
a scheme as anyone could think up. Here, give
us a grip of an end, and we'll get ready for business!"</p>

<p>Quickly they clutched the four corners of the
sheet. Fortunately, it appeared to be a fairly new
bed-covering, and might be trusted to bear a certain
weight without tearing.</p>

<p>Having reached the point where nothing more
could be done in order to assist Rob, the other two
scouts had to stand there and wait, as the precious
seconds crept by, each seeming like an age to their
anxious hearts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of Rob, who had, without the
least hesitation, risked his life in order to save the
child forgotten in the excitement of the Uhlans'
coming, and the strange events that had so soon
followed?</p>

<p>When he reached that window, he found it
closed, but, on his pressing against the sash, it
had swung inward, allowing him free access to
the room.</p>

<p>It was rather an appalling prospect that con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>fronted
Rob. The smoke seemed to be thick, and
he could not see three feet away. For all he knew
the fire that was raging in the lower part of the
inn might by this time have eaten partly through
the floor boards, so that, if he put his weight on
them, he stood a chance of being precipitated into
the midst of the flames.</p>

<p>Rob never hesitated a second. He had taken
all these matters into consideration when making
up his mind as to what he meant to attempt.
More than this, he did not believe anything partaking
of such a disaster threatened him in case
he entered that apartment.</p>

<p>The most he feared was that he might be unable
to discover where the child lay, for it was
manifestly impossible to use one's eyes to any advantage,
with all that veil of smoke interfering.</p>

<p>Over the window-sill he climbed, just as the
two boys below witnessed. And, no sooner did
Rob find himself in the room, than he started to
cross it. He expected to find a bed somewhere,
and toward this purpose he at once set himself.</p>

<p>He could hear the crackling of the flames below.
Besides this, there came to him with pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ful
distinctness the wails of the poor woman who
was being restrained from trying to rush into the
burning inn.</p>

<p>Rob was listening for something more. He
had strong hopes that he might catch another
sound, perhaps feeble, but enough to guide him
to where the imperiled one lay in the bed or on
the floor.</p>

<p>Groping as he advanced, and at the same time
feeling with his feet, in case the object he sought
should prove to be on the floor, Rob passed away
from the vicinity of the open window. The smoke
was pouring from the aperture now, as though it
were in the nature of a funnel. This turned out
to be of considerable help to the boy, for the
draught served to thin the smoke that had filled
the room to suffocation.</p>

<p>Now he had reached the farther wall, and,
turning sharply to one side, started to comb this,
every second expecting to come upon a bed of
some sort.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Rob thought he
heard a low, gasping cry just ahead of him.
Though unable to use his eyes with any measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>of success in locating the source of the sound, he
was encouraged, and persisted in pushing forward.
In this way he found himself bending over
a cot.</p>

<p>His groping hand came in contact with something
warm&mdash;something that moved ever so
slightly at his touch. It was the forgotten child.
Rob found that it was a mere baby, possibly not
much more than a year old.</p>

<p>The smoke had not yet choked the little thing,
though a short time longer would have certainly
finished it.</p>

<p>Rob had no sooner clutched it in his arms than
he tried to set himself right for the window by
means of which he had reached the room. In
this he was assisted by the light that came
through the opening, and which served as his
guide. By the time he reached it, he could no
longer see a single thing, and, when he leaned out
of the window, his first thought was to shout:</p>

<p>"Merritt, are you down below? I can't see a
thing! The smoke has blinded me!"</p>

<p>To his great satisfaction there came an immediate
response, and never had words from the lips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>of his chum sounded sweeter than they did then.</p>

<p>"Yes, we're both here, Rob. Let the child drop
straight down! We'll take good care of it!"</p>

<p>"But you might miss it," objected Rob, still
unable to see a thing.</p>

<p>"We can't! We've got a sheet spread out to
catch it in!" Merritt sent back. "You're all right
just there! Let go! Leave the rest to us!"</p>

<p>So Rob did as he was told. Accustomed to giving
orders himself, he at the same time could obey
when the necessity arose. Perhaps it was with
considerable fear that he allowed the child to
leave his grip; but the joyful shout arising from
his chums below assured him that all was well.</p>

<p>Then he heard a feminine shriek, and judged
that the frantic mother had darted to where the
boys were standing, to clasp her rescued offspring
to her breast.</p>

<p>Rob crawled over the ledge. He could not see
how to make that friendly limb again, but then
there was no need of going to all that trouble.
He had dropped in safety before, and felt able to
do the same again; so down he came like a plummet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>MYSTERIOUS SIGNALS IN THE NIGHT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Of course once Rob found himself away from
that pungent smoke his sight was gradually restored
to him, though for quite a while his eyeballs
smarted more or less from the experience.</p>

<p>"What will we do now?" asked Tubby, who
was very happy in the knowledge that he had
been allowed to have at least a hand, two of them,
he affirmed, in the saving of the little one.</p>

<p>"I did have an idea of staying here all night,"
returned Rob. "But, since the inn has been destroyed,
or will be utterly before the fire dies
down, of course that's out of the question."</p>

<p>"You remember we asked questions of the tavern-keeper,"
Merritt remarked. "He told us
there was another village about three miles farther
on along the road. We might make out to
go there, and see if they will put us up. If not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>it's a haystack for ours, provided there are any
haystacks around."</p>

<p>"H'm! three miles or more, on that animated
saw-buck, eh? I like that. It just invigorates
me, of course," they heard Tubby telling himself,
but his voice was anything but cheerful.</p>

<p>"Here comes the mother and the baby; she
wants to thank you, Rob," Merritt told the patrol
leader.</p>

<p>"Let's hurry and get out of this, then!" urged
Rob, who, above all things, seemed to dislike being
made a hero of when he felt that he had not
done anything worth mentioning after all.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" exclaimed Tubby, laying violent
hands on his chum. "It's only fair that you
give the poor woman a chance to tell you how
grateful she is. As it stands to reason she speaks
only Flemish, none of us can make head or tail
out of what she says, unless she mentions that
one word I know, which isn't likely."</p>

<p>But the woman could talk French, and she
made it very evident to Rob that her mother heart
was full of gratitude to him for what he had done.
To the intense amusement of Tubby, she even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>kissed Rob again and again, on either cheek,
after the manner of the Belgians.</p>

<p>"Bully! That's the ticket! Give him another
for his mother! I like to see anyone appreciate a
<i>real</i> hero. And here's the innkeeper; mebbe he'll
want to add a few little caresses, too, Rob. Now,
don't grieve his heart by refusing. They all do
it over here, I reckon."</p>

<p>The man who had owned the inn contented
himself, however, by telling Rob just how much
he appreciated the gallant work of the American
Boy Scout. Rob would not soon forget that experience;
and it must always bring a warm feeling
to his heart when thinking of how, with such
a little effort, he had made these two humble people
supremely happy.</p>

<p>When he tried to make the man accept pay for
their food, the other utterly refused to listen to
such a thing.</p>

<p>"It is the good wife and myself, young m'sieu,
who are heavily in your debt," he told Rob, with
the simplicity of sincerity. "How, then, could
we ever forgive ourselves for taking money from
one who has saved our baby's life? It would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>cause the blush of shame to dye our cheeks. We
could never look our neighbors again in the face.
It would not be right."</p>

<p>Of course that ended it, although Rob would
rather have settled for that supper. Merritt
tugged at his coat, understanding what it was all
about.</p>

<p>"Don't insist, Rob," he told the other. "You
mustn't try to take away the satisfaction he feels
in having done one little thing for you. Let it
go at that. He is not a poor man, I imagine, and
has something laid by. Now, hadn't we better
be getting out of here?"</p>

<p>"Oh! by the way, where are our horses?" asked
Tubby, suddenly.</p>

<p>That reminded them they had forgotten all
about the animals. The horses had been left tied
to a rail at some little distance alongside the inn
when they went in to get supper. Rob had intended,
in case they meant to spend the night
there, to have the three animals taken care of, and
fed.</p>

<p>The hitching bar was entirely destitute of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>horses of any type when they turned their eyes in
that quarter.</p>

<p>"What if those awful Uhlans took our steeds
away with them?" Tubby suggested, with his
usual blank look, and that woebegone shake of
his head.</p>

<p>"It seems unbelievable to me," Rob replied;
"but I'll make some inquiries. The inn-keeper
may have had them taken to the stables back
yonder, though I remember noticing the animals
at the time we were peeping out of the window
when the troopers were coming down the village
street. Wait for me, and I'll ask him."</p>

<p>"I surely hope you learn good news, Rob!"
Tubby sighed, as he thought of three long Belgian
miles separating him from some sort of bed,
where he could secure the rest he needed so
badly.</p>

<p>Presently Rob came back, and, when Tubby
saw him shake his head in the negative, he gave
a dull sort of a groan.</p>

<p>"Bottom knocked out of everything, is it,
Rob?" he asked, in a dazed sort of way.</p>

<p>"Well, nobody could give me any hope," was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>the reply. "Of course, the landlord was too excited
over the burning of his house to notice just
what the Uhlans did as they rode away, but one
man told us he saw the troopers take our horses
trailing behind them."</p>

<p>"Then that settles it," said Merritt; "though
I'll never understand what they could want with
those bony and tired nags, unless it was to make
bologna sausages out of. We're in for a little
hike that will stretch our legs."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess it will," echoed Tubby, in a way
that was hardly cheerful.</p>

<p>"And yours can stand a good deal of stretching,
Tubby, you know," added Merritt.</p>

<p>"There's no use crying over spilt milk," said
Rob, in his usual cheery fashion. "I more than
half expected that we'd lose our mounts, sooner
or later."</p>

<p>"So did I," agreed Merritt. "Only I thought
perhaps they'd die on our hands from over-exertion.
I never dreamed that rough riders like the
German cavalrymen would want to be caught
leading such ragtag animals along."</p>

<p>"Well, shall we make a move?" asked Rob.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>There being no word against it, even from
Tubby, who knew when duty called, the three
scouts took their last look at the still burning
houses, and then strode forth on the road leading
toward the east.</p>

<p>The night promised to be unusually clear, for
one thing. This pleased Rob, for, as they would
have no moon to light them on their way, even
the stars were welcome.</p>

<p>Three miles, under ordinary conditions, would
have been reckoned almost nothing to scouts accustomed
to taking lengthy hikes over hills and
along valleys. It was a different matter, however,
when passing through a war-distracted
country, where hostile armies were encamped, so
that at any minute they were apt to be greeted
with a stern command, either in German or in
French or Flemish, to stand and give the countersign,
with the warning that to attempt flight
would be at the peril of their lives.</p>

<p>Naturally the nerves of the boys were continually
on edge. Tubby, in particular, kept his
eyes roving from side to side, then into the uncertain
distance ahead; and even at times turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>to ascertain whether they were being pursued by
some soft-footed enemies who thought to take
them by surprise.</p>

<p>In this way more than a mile was passed over.
When Rob announced that he believed they must
be all of halfway to the other village, Tubby expressed
fervent thanks.</p>

<p>"I'm still able to put one foot in front of the
other," he remarked in a hushed voice, for Rob
had cautioned them against speaking aloud, as
it might draw unwelcome attention to the little
party.</p>

<p>"Wait up a minute, please," whispered Merritt,
and there was that about his mysterious manner
that gave Tubby another bad shock.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, now, Merritt?" he asked
softly but solicitously. "Hope you haven't got a
stone bruise on your heel. Did you hear anything
suspicious? Are we going to be held up
by a patrol? Oh! dear, why don't you hurry and
tell us the worst?"</p>

<p>"What do you make of that flickering light
over there, Rob?" asked Merritt. "It seems to
be in an open field, as near as I can understand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Just watch how it keeps on jumping up and down,
then sideways."</p>

<p>"Why, it caught my eye just about the time
you spoke, Merritt," came the reply from the
patrol leader. "It must either be the work of
some crazy person, or else a way of signaling
by lantern."</p>

<p>"Say, I honestly believe you've struck the truth
that shot, Rob," broke in Tubby, who had, of
course, immediately turned toward the spot indicated.
"See the way he swings the light around
and makes all manner of figures in the air with
the same. Why, that was the letter N, as sure
as you live. And there goes E, followed by W
and S. What does that spell but NEWS? Hey!
we're on the track of a discovery!"</p>

<p>"Will you keep still, Tubby, and let's see if he
begins again?" said Merritt eagerly.</p>

<p>"That must have been the last word of his
message," remarked Rob quickly, "but chances
are he'll repeat it. Stand ready to spell it out as
well as we can. Three scouts accustomed to
reading the Myers code of fire signaling ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>to&mdash;&mdash; There, that was C; and after that O, A,
S, T&mdash;which means COAST."</p>

<p>Slowly, and somewhat laboriously, the boys
spelled the message, letter for letter, their previous
training proving of the greatest help; and
this was the result:</p>

<p>"<i>Coast clear&mdash;safe landing here&mdash;important
news!</i>"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE MEETING BETWEEN THE LINES.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Good for us! We're the ones to read a message!
But say, was that in German, or French,
or English, I want to know?" and Tubby seized
his chums each by an arm, as he asked this question
in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>"When you come to making dots and dashes
in the Morse code, or what answers for the same
with the heliograph, or a torch, or signal flags,
I guess all languages are the same!" Merritt told
him, more to keep Tubby quiet than for any other
reason.</p>

<p>"The question is, who could that message
have been for?" Rob was muttering.</p>

<p>"There, he starts in again," said Tubby. "He's
a most persistent sort of chap, I take it, and
means that the other fellow will get that message,
sooner or later. What 'coast is clear'? Why,
we're miles and miles away from the sea-shore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>now, ain't we? And what under the sun does
he mean by 'safe landing'? Where's the boat
going to come from, somebody tell me quick?"</p>

<p>"I think I know," Rob had just managed to say
in reply, when all of them were suddenly startled
to hear a queer, rattling sound from behind that
kept swiftly drawing nearer and nearer, until
presently Tubby, in sheer alarm, dropped flat to
the ground.</p>

<p>As he lay sprawled out on his back, judge of
his astonishment when he saw some object, that
was like an immense bird, pass over not fifty
feet above him. It was heading directly for the
spot where the light of the lantern glowed in that
open field.</p>

<p>The shuttle sound abruptly ceased.</p>

<p>"He's shut off his engine," remarked Rob, apparently
intensely interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, because he means to alight in the field,"
added Merritt.</p>

<p>Tubby suddenly comprehended what it must
apparently mean. He hastened to scramble to
his feet again, and no sooner had he accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>plished
this than he was, of course, busily engaged
with his questions.</p>

<p>"Was that an aëroplane, Rob?"</p>

<p>"It certainly was," he was informed.</p>

<p>"Then that signal was for the pilot; that was
what it meant by 'safe landing here' and 'coast
clear!' Oh! I begin to see it all now. The 'important
news' he mentioned in his message must
be something a spy has gathered, and which he
wants this air-pilot to carry back to the German
lines for him? Am I on the right track, Rob?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's about what it all means, Tubby."</p>

<p>"Then that machine must have been one of
the Taube aëroplanes they told us about?"</p>

<p>"We expect it is," replied the obliging Rob.</p>

<p>"It must have landed by now, then, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"As we can hear nothing moving, that's about
the way things stand," replied the patrol leader.</p>

<p>"Please shut up, Tubby, so we can listen,"
Merritt suggested, not unkindly, but with the
authority that his position as second in command
of the Eagle Patrol allowed him to display.</p>

<p>Tubby thereupon collapsed; that is, he simply
mumbled to himself, while staring as hard as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>could toward the spot where they could see that
feeble little glow, made by the signaling lantern.</p>

<p>Rob was considerably interested in the adventure.
It appealed to him in a way that was almost
irresistible. He could understand that this
might be only one of many methods taken by
the astute Germans to get valuable information
to the Staff Headquarters, which were at that
time supposed to be located in the captured Belgian
capital of Brussels.</p>

<p>Some spy, who had the run of the Belgian
lines, would gather up certain information which
he believed might be appreciated. Then, at a
given time, when darkness covered the land, he
was to be waiting for a daring aviator, who
would take such risks as always accompany night
traveling and landing with an aëroplane.</p>

<p>If the man aloft failed to receive the signal
agreed on, he would hover around up to a certain
hour, and then go back to Brussels. But, if
the coast was clear, and the secret agent gave
him assurance to that effect, he could dart down,
and take charge of the precious documents or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>maps showing the positions of various hostile
forces, or else some new arrangement on the part
of the defenses of Antwerp.</p>

<p>"I'd like to be able to just crawl up closer, and
see what goes on," Merritt remarked, after they
had stood there for a little while, listening and
watching, yet seeing only that small light in the
open space under the stars.</p>

<p>"Would it be safe?" asked Tubby cautiously;
though, no doubt, if his chums decided on the
venture, he would be found remaining at their
side.</p>

<p>As often happened, here again Rob had to
show his leadership, and curb his chum's impetuosity.
Merritt was apt to do things sometimes
on the impulse of the moment which were really
unwise.</p>

<p>The prospect of stealing along, like Indians on
the warpath, and gradually drawing closer to the
spot where the pilot of the air-craft and the spy
were in consultation, was very inviting. Rob,
however, took a grip on himself, and decided that
it would be most unwise of them to accept such
an unnecessary risk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>"It's really none of our business, Merritt," he
said. "First of all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course not, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And, if they discovered us, you know what
it would mean?" Rob continued gravely.</p>

<p>"I suppose they would fire on us," admitted
Merritt.</p>

<p>"They certainly would, because they could only
believe that we were enemies," continued the
other, who, once he had started in to convince
an impulsive comrade, believed in delivering
sledge-hammer blows in succession, "and we're
not aching to be filled with lead just yet."</p>

<p>"But," urged Merritt, "we might move along
the road just a little bit farther; that would take
us closer to the place. I'd like to be able to see
that Taube machine fly over our heads again."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no objection to doing that, only
we must keep mighty quiet. And, Tubby, mind
your feet!" said Rob.</p>

<p>Tubby did not bother making any reply, for
none seemed necessary. He knew well enough
that, as a rule, he was inclined to be clumsy, and
could stumble, if given even half a chance. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>on the open road, and with the starlight to help
out, he could not believe there was any danger.</p>

<p>So he sniffed disdainfully, and braced himself
to move as softly as a cat; for it is wonderful
how light on their feet most fat people can be,
when they try their best.</p>

<p>Of course they could not see a thing, but then,
imagination often helps out, and by this means
they could picture the daring air-pilot, having
successfully landed, in consultation with the secret
agent.</p>

<p>When he had delivered what news he had
picked up, perhaps verbally as well as through
some written process, the spy would most likely
assist the flier to get his Taube under way again,
after which he could return to take up his risky
profession amidst the Belgian forces.</p>

<p>Once Tubby did come near falling, as his toe
caught in a projecting stone, which, of course,
had been invisible. He managed to clutch hold
of Merritt, who was on his left, and in this way
avoided a tumble that might have caused more
or less noise, even if it did not result in any damage
to his nose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>Then Rob came to a stop. The others understood
that he must have decided they were as
near the place where the lantern glowed in the
field as they could get without clambering over
the stone barrier. This wall fence came up to
Tubby's chin, so that he had to stand on his tiptoes
to see over it.</p>

<p>"Has he sailed away yet, Rob?" asked Tubby,
in his hushed voice, which sounded as though he
might be using the soft pedal on his vocal organ.</p>

<p>"We would have heard the clatter of his motor
if he had," returned Rob. "So far it hasn't
been found possible to deaden the rattle of the
propeller. And, on a still night like this, you
could get that some ways off. No, they're talking
business yet, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! but they must have a lot to say,"
muttered Tubby.</p>

<p>"After they separate we'd better lie low a
while," suggested Rob.</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded Tubby, bound to understand
everything, even if he had to swamp
his mates with questions.</p>

<p>"The spy, or spies, for there may be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>than one of them, might just happen to cross
this way, so as to get to the road; and, if they
saw three shadowy figures moving along, the
first thing they'd be apt to think was that we
were enemies who had been listening."</p>

<p>"Oh! now I see!" Tubby admitted. "And,
since we don't want to be made targets for them
to practice at, we'll be wise to do what you say,
Rob."</p>

<p>"Please, please, let up on all that talk, Tubby!"
implored Merritt.</p>

<p>"Oh! I will, if it bothers you any," the fat boy
answered; "but I think it queer a fellow can't ask
a few little innocent questions once in a while,
without being sat down on so hard. Now, I
know a boy who made himself a real nuisance
with his everlasting wanting-to-know, but I only
speak up when there's absolute nec&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tubby stopped short there. It was not that
the annoyed Merritt clasped a hand over his
mouth, thus shutting off his supply of breath, for
no such thought entered the mind of the corporal
of the Eagle Patrol; but just then a horrible
din, in which shots, mingled with wild shouts,
broke out in the field nearby.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>CAUGHT IN THE ACT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>What had happened was no mystery to Rob
and Merritt, though possibly Tubby, not quite so
apt to jump to conclusions, remained a little bewildered
at what was going on.</p>

<p>It seemed that the Belgians must have suspected
something wrong, and possibly followed
the bearer of the lantern when he went into the
open field to flash his signals toward the sky.</p>

<p>The three scouts from across the ocean were
not the only watchers who had read that message.
Yes, and the coast had not been as clear
as the signal man believed, since even then enemies
must have been creeping toward him,
though utterly unseen in the darkness.</p>

<p>The rapid discharge of guns, and the loud outcries
of men engaged in desperate warfare,
thrilled the boys. They could not see a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>figure, but the spiteful flashing of firearms, as
they were discharged, told them that the fight
was not all one-sided, and that the Germans must
be resisting capture with their usual valor.</p>

<p>All at once they heard another sound.</p>

<p>"It's the motor&mdash;the aëroplane man has managed
to get going!" exclaimed Rob, instantly
comprehending what that meant.</p>

<p>In order to rise, after starting his machine, it
was necessary for the aviator to first skim along
the field for a little distance, and gradually gain
an impetus which, at the proper instant, results
in a slow ascent.</p>

<p>Of course he was taking all sorts of desperate
chances in making this blind venture; but his life
was at stake, if caught. Besides, he undoubtedly
must have examined the nature of that level
stretch of ground before, and selected it as a
landing place on account of its good qualities.</p>

<p>"He's heading this way, Rob!" exclaimed Tubby,
almost in a panic.</p>

<p>"If he butts into this wall it'll spell his finish!"
added Merritt.</p>

<p>"No danger of that," said Rob. "He knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>every foot of ground around here. But duck
down, everybody. They will fire a volley after
him, and we might get in line of the bullets."</p>

<p>Tubby dropped flat, forgetting that the high
stone wall was as good a breastwork as any one
could want.</p>

<p>Just as Rob had anticipated, there was a series
of explosions, and they could even hear the patter
of bullets striking the piled-up stones composing
the wall.</p>

<p>This was enough to tell them that the fleeing
aviator had headed straight toward the spot
where they were crouching. And, as the rattle
of his machine grew louder, they realized that he
was approaching them with considerable speed.</p>

<p>Then, with an additional clatter, the Taube
passed over the wall, clearing its top by not more
than ten feet.</p>

<p>"Keep down!" exclaimed Rob, feeling Merritt
beginning to make a move, and afraid lest he
should stand upright in order to better follow the
progress of the aëroplane.</p>

<p>It was well he spoke when he did, for another
burst of firing came. The soldiers were sending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>random volleys after the fleeing airman, in hopes
of injuring his machinery or wounding the aviator
himself.</p>

<p>"That was sure a great getaway!" bubbled
Tubby, still seated there on the ground.</p>

<p>"But I rather think they winged him," added
Merritt, possibly with a note of regret in his
voice.</p>

<p>It was not that he felt any particular sympathy
for the German cause; but, boy-like, he could
admire grit and daring, no matter under what
flag it might be found. That bold flight of the
Taube operator in the face of the flying missiles
was quite enough to arouse the spirit of any one
with red blood in his veins.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" asked Tubby,
not meaning to remain in ignorance when he possessed
a ready tongue.</p>

<p>"I was pretty sure the machine wabbled as it
passed over," said Merritt.</p>

<p>"My opinion, too," Rob chimed in. "It seemed
to me he was trying his best to get it to mount,
but it balked. That could only mean something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>had gone wrong with the machinery, or else a
wing had been fractured."</p>

<p>"Huh! you talk just like the machine might be
a baseball pitcher," commented Tubby. "But, if
that's the case, the chances are he'll drop to
the ground right away, or else smash up against
some tree."</p>

<p>"Just what may happen to him," agreed Merritt.</p>

<p>"You'll notice that the sound of motor and propeller
has suddenly died out," suggested Rob,
"which I take it looks pretty rough for the man-bird."</p>

<p>"Oh! that would be too bad, now!" Tubby
whimpered, as he imagined he could see the bold
pilot of the crippled flier dashed to the ground
amidst the wreckage of his machine.</p>

<p>"Well, the shooting seems to be over!" remarked
Merritt.</p>

<p>"I wonder what happened to the spy?" Rob
observed, as he stared over the top of the stone
wall toward the spot where the late confusion
had taken place.</p>

<p>They could still see that little glow, proving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>that the lantern had not been kicked over in all
the riot when the creeping Belgians had pounced
on the enemy.</p>

<p>"Would it be wise for us to head over there
now, Rob?"</p>

<p>Plainly Merritt was curious to know what had
happened, and his manner of putting this question
to the patrol leader showed that he would
never be satisfied unless they made some sort of
attempt to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>This time he found Rob more agreeable. Conditions
had changed considerably since the leader
had put his foot down upon any suggestion that
they thrust themselves into the game. The Belgians
were their friends, and they could not believe
any danger was to be feared from that
source.</p>

<p>"We might walk over that way," Rob admitted
slowly; "that is, if Tubby can get over this
wall."</p>

<p>"If not, he could wait for us here," suggested
Merritt, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"I see myself waiting all alone on the other
side of the wall, while you two step forward and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>find out all there is going on. I can climb walls,
all right, if somebody only gives me a little
boost. Try me, and see, Rob. That's a good fellow!"</p>

<p>Of course Rob was ready to lend the desired
assistance; and as Tubby secured a hold on a
large stone that crowned the wall, he was able
to hunch himself up, puffing and grunting at a
great rate.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to get down, if one did
not care how he fell; but Tubby proved fortunate
in finding toe places where he could secure
a hold, and in some fashion managed to
"dismount."</p>

<p>He pattered after his two chums, who were already
moving toward the middle of the big field.</p>

<p>Rob, always noticing things as he went along,
found that the field was very level, and he could
understand how the place must have been selected
for a rendezvous since it offered such
exceptional facilities for an aëroplane to land
and start up again.</p>

<p>Perhaps this had been a regular nightly affair,
and all sorts of valuable information may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>have been carried to the German Headquarters
by means of this novel air route.</p>

<p>As the three boys gradually drew nearer the
place where the lantern could still be seen, they
discovered that it was now being held in the
hand of some person who wore a uniform.</p>

<p>"Belgians, all right!" muttered Rob, after
noting that the garb was not like the khaki-colored
clothes of the British troops, nor yet
the blue and red of the French soldiers.</p>

<p>There seemed to be more than a dozen of the
men, showing that they had come in force.
Whether they had discovered the spy by accident
or followed him to the place of meeting,
Rob, of course, could only guess; nor did it matter
to him.</p>

<p>"I can see the prisoner!" whispered Merritt.</p>

<p>"Yes, and there seem to be two of them,"
added Rob, noting that the men were being held
by several soldiers, and it was as though the
officer in command might be questioning them
closely, for a voice could be heard speaking in
French.</p>

<p>"They've been up against hard knocks, it looks
like," Tubby mentioned, eager to let his chums
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>know he was close at their heels, and able to see
a few things for himself.</p>

<p>Indeed, the men did have the appearance of
having been through the mill. Their hats were
missing, so that their hair hung about their
faces, which looked as if they had been brought
in contact with a pile-driver, for there was blood,
also contusions and bruises visible.</p>

<p>"And one of them stands as if he hadn't any
use for his left leg, which means most likely he's
got a bullet through it," Rob continued.</p>

<p>He spoke aloud, and for a reason. It were
better that the soldiers in the field learned of
their advance by some such method as this. If,
on the other hand, the trio of scouts were detected
advancing in any sort of suspicious manner
they might be unfortunate enough to evoke
a volley. Excited men sometimes shoot first
and ask questions afterward.</p>

<p>A harsh voice suddenly demanded in French
to know who they were, and what they had to
say for themselves; adding that unless they replied
instantly the order to cut them down would
be given.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE FIELD HOSPITAL.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"We are friends, three American boys only!"</p>

<p>Very often Rob had practiced his French so
as to get this explanation correct. If his accent
happened to be altogether wrong, what he
said could be understood, and that was the main
thing.</p>

<p>Apparently, what he had called out must have
surprised the Belgian officer in charge of the
detachment, for he could be heard exchanging
comments with someone else. Then he spoke
aloud again.</p>

<p>"Advance, and hold up your hands above your
heads!" he ordered.</p>

<p>Rob understood the words, but of course his
chums could not; so the first thing he did was
to elevate both hands as high as he could, and
say to them:</p>

<p>"Do the same as I am, both of you. The officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>has ordered it. And then come on over to where
they are waiting for us!"</p>

<p>In this manner they drew near the spot where
the others stood. Everyone was staring very
hard, for to see three boys dressed in khaki, and
talking unmistakable English among themselves,
was indeed a considerable surprise.</p>

<p>The one who held the lantern proved to be
a lieutenant. He was a man of middle age, and
as the newcomers drew near he held up his light
in order the better to examine their make-up.
What he saw must have created a good impression,
for the frown began to leave his face.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate that I speak English," he
started in to say, greatly to the delight as well
as the surprise of Rob, "so you shall tell me
how it comes we find you here on this particular
night, and so close to a spot where a suspicious
transaction was going on which we had the
pleasure of nipping in the bud."</p>

<p>Apparently the lieutenant was not wholly satisfied.
He could not tell but that these smart
looking boys might have some connection with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>the game he and his detachment had blocked in
the capture of the two spies.</p>

<p>So Rob hastened to explain as briefly as he
could.</p>

<p>"We have come to Belgium on some very
important business that has nothing whatever to
do with the war. There is a man we must see,
and it happens that he was last reported in a
town near Brussels. We know what great
risks we run in trying to pass between the lines
of the hostile armies; but we hope to keep out
of the hands of the Germans; and as for the
Belgians, we are carrying with us a letter that
has up to now always passed us."</p>

<p>This was the signal for Merritt to produce
the passport written for them by the obliging
burgomaster of Antwerp. The lieutenant received
the paper gravely. He was evidently puzzled
to know how much of Rob's strange story
to believe; for it seemed remarkable that three
boys should take such a dangerous mission upon
their shoulders.</p>

<p>When he had read the short recommendation
through, and saw the signature at the bottom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>the officer uttered an exclamation of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You could not have chosen a better sponsor
than the worthy burgomaster of Antwerp," he
said warmly. "I have met him more than once,
and he is held in high respect throughout the
land, as is Burgomaster Max of Brussels. Let
me return your paper safely. It is worth keeping."</p>

<p>"And you will allow us to go on when we
choose, then?" asked Merritt eagerly.</p>

<p>"There is no occasion for your detention," he
was informed, "but if I sought your best welfare
I should order that you turn back, and
give up this foolish mission, for there is hardly
one chance in ten that you can escape capture
at the hands of the enemy, since they are everywhere.
But you know best, and I shall not interfere.
It must be a serious motive that brings
you into this wretched country?"</p>

<p>"It means a great lot to my family that I find
this man, Steven Meredith," Merritt told him,
possibly with a faint hope that the lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>might recognize the name, and admit that he
knew the person.</p>

<p>Rob had noticed several things. For one, that
the taller prisoner was certainly badly wounded,
since he stood on one leg, and had his teeth
tightly clinched as if to keep from betraying
any weakness that might be deemed unmanly.</p>

<p>One of the Belgians also carried a bandage,
roughly fastened, possibly by a clumsy
comrade, around his arm. It showed traces of
blood, and Rob could guess that a speeding bullet
fired by the spies at bay probably had caused
the wound.</p>

<p>"I notice that a couple of men here have been
wounded," he ventured to say to the lieutenant,
"and, as you must know, Boy Scouts are taught
something of field surgery. Would you mind if
I and my friend here looked at them? We might
stop the flow of blood, anyway, and perhaps
make the men a bit easier."</p>

<p>The Belgian officer hesitated for a brief time.
He looked at Rob, and seemed to be considering.
Then he nodded his head.</p>

<p>"As we have to stay here until my superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>officer and a larger detachment come along in
answer to the signals we are about to make, it
could do no harm. Yes, I have heard that Boy
Scouts are supposed to know something of surgery,
although I myself have never seen them
practice it. You may proceed. Albert!"</p>

<p>He beckoned to the private who had his arm
bound up. The man upon being told to show
his injury hardly knew what was about to happen.
He could not believe that mere boys would
know what a surgeon was supposed to do.</p>

<p>That man evidently had the surprise of his
life when Rob, assisted by Merritt, washed the
wound by the aid of some water obtained from
a canteen, and then neatly bound the arm up,
using some strips from a little roll of linen which
Rob took from his pocket.</p>

<p>The officer watched the whole operation with
considerable interest.</p>

<p>"That was neatly done," he commented, after
the man had stepped back to where a comrade
was holding his gun for him. "As you expressed
a wish to attend to the prisoner, I give you full
permission to do so. Though, after all, it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>make but little difference with him, since his
doom is sealed."</p>

<p>The tall German said never a word, but allowed
the boys to do as they willed with him.
He realized the desperate condition in which
his boldness had placed him and was evidently
determined, if convicted of being a spy, to die
game.</p>

<p>His injury turned out to be much more serious
than that of the Belgian soldier, for the
bullet had made a bad puncture, and he had already
lost much blood.</p>

<p>Tubby turned his head away at first, as though
he could not bear to see the wound, but evidently
realizing that a display of such timidity was
hardly in keeping with what they wished these
men to believe of Boy Scouts, he finally forced
himself to offer to assist his chums in their gruesome
work.</p>

<p>It took all of ten minutes to wash and dress
that wound with the few things at their command
the best they were able to. During all that
time the spy did not say a word, nor did he groan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>even when Rob knew he must be hurting him
more or less, although that could not be avoided.</p>

<p>And the officer had commenced to ask questions.
It seemed to surprise him that even in
far-away America there, too, the boys had organized
themselves into patrols and learned all
these valuable lessons calculated to make them
better citizens when they came to take their
places in business, on the firing line, or among
the professions.</p>

<p>"Then the scouts over in your country are also
taught to be ready for any emergency, the same
as the boys are in Belgium?" he asked Rob, as
he watched the latter's nimble fingers, with considerable
dexterity into the bargain, draw the
bandage tightly into place.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," replied the boy, only too pleased
to say a good word for the thousands upon thousands
of comrades in khaki whom he represented.
"You see, most of us camp out a good deal, and
all sorts of accidents happen. I've known a boy
to cut himself so badly with an ax when he was
chopping wood that he would have bled to death
long before they could get him to a doctor, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>it was easy for his mates to stop the flow of
blood, and do the right thing."</p>

<p>"It is grand, this teaching boys to be able
to save human life," declared the middle-aged
officer, who perhaps had sons of his own in the
army, "and yet it never came to me before that
even in America they were practicing these noble
avocations. I have seen them in England,
yes, in France also, but in America&mdash;it is superb
to think of it. And there are other ways in
which boys in camp could be injured, you are
telling me?"</p>

<p>He had become so deeply interested that Rob
only too willingly proceeded to explain at greater
length.</p>

<p>"Why, sometimes a boy is taken with a cramp
when in swimming, and of course he is saved by
those who know just how to get him without
being pulled down themselves."</p>

<p>"And," continued the Belgian lieutenant, "if
the poor fellow should be nearly gone, what then?
I myself once had a narrow escape that way,
and to this day it gives me a cold feeling every
time I remember it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh! every scout, even when he's a tenderfoot,
is supposed to learn how to resuscitate a
comrade who has swallowed lots of water, and
come near drowning. Unless he was pulled out
too late, he will be brought back every time.
Then there are the bites from poisonous snakes
and insects that may happen; we are taught how
best to counteract the effect of poison, so as to
save the victim."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to know all this," the officer
told them. "It has been quite a pleasure to have
met you, although under peculiar conditions, I
admit. And the more I see of you, young messieurs,
the more I am convinced that you can
look out for yourselves. At first I considered
it was a shame that three tender boys were allowed
to travel over this dangerous country. I
no longer feel that way. If anybody should
know how to take care of themselves, I surely
believe you know, and are equal to do it. I am
proud to shake hands with you, and wish you
all a successful journey."</p>

<p>Which operation he proceeded to immediately
put into execution; though Tubby, having had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>one previous experience with a hearty Belgian
hand-grip, was mighty careful just how he allowed
the other to take hold of his plump digits.</p>

<p>Rob was quite satisfied now that they had done
the right thing in coming forward and joining
the party. At least it had been the means of
easing the pain of those who were wounded, and
stopping the flow of blood sensibly.</p>

<p>The German had actually broken his silence
to thank the boys when they finished their work.
It was evident, however, that he was not caring
very much what happened to him, since he knew
the probable penalty for allowing himself to be
captured in the act of delivering important plans
of fortifications&mdash;death.</p>

<p>None of the boys so much as mentioned the
fact that they believed the Taube machine might
have been injured, and even fallen a short distance
away. If the Belgians did not see fit to
investigate conditions, it was no part of the
scouts' business to put them on the track. The
dashing aviator deserved to get away, Rob
thought, and it would hardly be fair for out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>siders,
who had really no interest in the matter,
to betray him to his enemies.</p>

<p>So they left the soldiers still waiting for their
comrades to come along with a superior officer
in charge. The lieutenant had taken quite a sudden
fancy for Rob and his two chums; but then
that was not strange, Tubby told himself, since
the patrol leader always had a knack of making
friends wherever he went.</p>

<p>They soon arrived at the stone wall, and to
Tubby's satisfaction found a break where they
could actually pass to the road without once
more climbing the barrier.</p>

<p>The last they saw of the field was when the
lighted lantern was being waved in a way that
looked as though the lieutenant might be signaling
to others. In the opposite quarter only darkness
was to be seen. Rob wondered what had
become of the operator of the Taube aëroplane;
whether he had indeed come crashing to the
earth, or managed to sail away to safety. But
they were never fated to know.</p>

<h3>CHASING A JACK-O'-LANTERN.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"I wish you could tell me we were nearly at
that old village, Rob. Seems to me we've been
trudging along for hours, and I own up to feeling
just a little bit tired."</p>

<p>Tubby had a beseeching way about him that
was hard to resist; and so Rob really felt sorry
that he could give him no joyful news.</p>

<p>"I would like to be able to tell in the worst
way, Tubby," he told him, "but you see we're
making this turn only on hearsay. None of us
knows a single thing about it. There must be
some sort of a place ahead of us, because several
times I've heard dogs barking, and I even
thought I could hear people calling."</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tubby," chimed in Merritt, "because
there's a light, yes,&mdash;two, three of the
same kind. We'll soon be there, and I hope we'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>find some sort of a bunk, even if we have to drop
in the hay."</p>

<p>"That's what I say," the fat scout declared energetically,
bracing up, now that it seemed the
haven might be in sight. "I could sleep standing
up, I believe, if only you braced me on the
sides."</p>

<p>"I believe you," remarked Merritt; and Tubby
hardly knew whether he ought to demand an
explanation of that insinuation or not; he finally
concluded to change the subject.</p>

<p>They soon found they had arrived at another
of those frequent little Belgian hamlets where,
in the past, thrift had held sway, but which were
rapidly becoming demoralized under the pressure
of the war fever. Most of the men were
serving the colors, of course, those remaining
being the very aged or crippled, the women, and
always the flocks of children.</p>

<p>"Seems to me they're carrying on kind of
queer here, as if something might be going on,"
Merritt hazarded while they were approaching
the border of the place.</p>

<p>"Gingersnaps and popguns!" exclaimed Tub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>by,
"I hope there isn't a bunch of those terrible
Uhlans in town, smashing things, and threatening
to burn every house unless the wine and the
ransom money are brought out!"</p>

<p>"Let's go slow till we can make sure about
that," suggested Rob.</p>

<p>Their recent unpleasant experience was so
fresh in their minds that they did not care to
have it duplicated. The next time they might
not be so fortunate about escaping from a burning
inn, or avoiding capture at the hands of raiding
Uhlans.</p>

<p>"I don't seem to glimpse any cavalrymen
around, do you, Rob?" Merritt questioned, as
they hovered on the outskirts of the place, ready
to melt away in the darkness should any peril
arise.</p>

<p>"No, and it's safe for us to push on," the patrol
leader announced.</p>

<p>"But there are a raft of people around," ventured
the cautious Tubby, who had been closely
observing each and every soul, as though he suspected
that crafty Uhlans might be hidden under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>peasants' garb, or in the clothes of the stout Belgian
dames.</p>

<p>"Well, a lot of them are fugitives, the same
as those we've been seeing on the roads all day
long," Rob explained. "Some of them have been
burned out of house and home; but in the main
they're people who have believed all these awful
fairy stories about the terrible Germans, and
think that if they stay they'll be eaten up."</p>

<p>"This place must have escaped a visit from
the Germans so far," Merritt suggested, "and
they are coming to believe it's a lucky town,
which would account for so many stopping here
in their rush to get away."</p>

<p>"That's bad!" muttered Tubby.</p>

<p>"Why is it?" demanded Merritt.</p>

<p>"All the spare beds will be taken, you see," explained
the other dejectedly, "and those who
come late, like we are doing, must sit up all night,
or else sleep in the dog kennel or the pigsty or
the barn. Well, I said before and I mean it, if
I can have some hay under me to keep my bones
from the floor, I won't complain, or make a single
kick. I'm easily satisfied, you all know."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>"That must be the village inn, over yonder,
Rob," Merritt remarked, pointing as he spoke.
"Judging from the crowd in front we've got a
poor show to get beds for to-night."</p>

<p>"Everybody stares at us as if they thought we
might be some kind of wild animal," Tubby complained.</p>

<p>"Well, I can see that they've had some sort
of circus here lately because the showbills are still
posted on the fences," Merritt observed with a
chuckle, "and can you blame them for thinking
that the side shows have bust up, with the freaks
hiking all through the country, unable to ride on
the railroads, which are all taken over by the
Government to haul cannon, horses and soldiers?
I'll pass for the Living Skeleton, while you could
stand for the Fat Boy, Tubby!"</p>

<p>Tubby was so used to having his friends joke
at him on account of his chubby build that as a
rule he let such reminders pass by without showing
any ill feeling. In this instance he hardly
noticed what Merritt was saying, because so
many other events were happening around them.</p>

<p>Being satisfied at last that they were in no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>apparent danger from concealed Uhlans, Tubby
felt his spirits rise once more.</p>

<p>At the inn Rob entered into a brief conversation
with the proprietor. As this worthy knew
very little French, and Rob next to nothing of
Flemish, the "confab," as Tubby called it, had
to be conducted mostly through a series of shrugs
and gestures.</p>

<p>"What luck, Rob?" asked Tubby, when the
other chum turned to them again.</p>

<p>"He's cram full of sleepers to-night, and
couldn't give us even a cot," explained Rob.
"When I said we'd put up with the hay, he gave
me to understand we could pick out any place
found unoccupied."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! 'unoccupied,' you said, didn't you,
Rob?" cried Tubby hastily. "Now, does that
mean the place is apt to be <i>swarming</i> with these
peasant women and children, and shall we have
to listen to babies bawling all night long, not
to speak of roosters crowing, dogs barking,
horses neighing, pigs grunting and cows mooing?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Beggars should never be choosers,' they
say," Merritt warned him.</p>

<p>"And, after all, let's hope it won't be quite so
bad as all that," said Rob.</p>

<p>They sought the stable. It was in the rear of
the inn, and a rather decent looking structure in
the bargain.</p>

<p>"Why, this isn't half bad," admitted Tubby, as
they entered and found that the kind proprietor
of the house had hung up a lighted lantern, by
means of which it was possible for the boys to
see the stack of hay.</p>

<p>"It smells like a sweet new crop," Rob remarked,
glad to find something to commend when
surrounded by such dismal prospects.</p>

<p>"And so far as I can see we're the only barn
guests," Tubby announced jubilantly as he started
to burrow in the hay.</p>

<p>He had hardly made much progress before he
came backing out in a hurry.</p>

<p>"There's a great big dog sleeping in there!"
he declared excitedly.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" asked Rob, who
could hardly believe it possible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>"I tell you he tried to bite me," urged Tubby,
holding up one finger of his right hand, and on
which a tiny speck of blood was visible.</p>

<p>"Shucks! you only stuck it on a thorn, that's
all!" protested the unbelieving Merritt, "and I'll
prove it by crawling in the same hole."</p>

<p>"Look out, now!" warned Tubby, anxious, and
yet with some eagerness, for he hoped to have
his words proved in a fashion even Merritt could
not doubt.</p>

<p>Immediately there was more or less excitement
in the hay; and then came the unmistakable
scolding of a setting hen. Merritt backed
out, laughing.</p>

<p>"There's your ferocious bulldog!" he told
Tubby; "but we'll leave old Biddy to her eggs,
and try another place. Plenty of room in this
hotel without chucking the other guests out of
their nests."</p>

<p>After a while they made themselves comfortable.
Tubby, before turning in, had prowled
around a little. He told the others that as a true
scout he was only taking an inventory of his
surroundings, so that if there should happen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>come a sudden midnight alarm he at least would
know what to do in order to lead the way out of
the barn by a rear exit.</p>

<p>"Smart boy, Tubby," Merritt told him, when
he heard him say this; and it always pleased the
fat scout to receive a word of praise, possibly
because the occasions when he deserved any were
few and far between.</p>

<p>They lay in the sweet hay, and talked in low
tones. No one else seemed to be pushed so hard
for a place to sleep as to come to the barn, for
which all of the chums professed to be very grateful.</p>

<p>In the course of the conversation, which had
more or less bearing on their strange mission
abroad, the subject of the precious paper came
to the front. Perhaps it was Merritt himself
who mentioned it, because the matter was frequently
in his thoughts, and he seemed to be
growing more and more anxious, the nearer they
drew to the place where he anticipated finding
Steven Meredith.</p>

<p>"You've never really told us who this man is,
Merritt, and how he comes to be wandering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>around the world with a paper belonging to your
grandfather hidden away under the lining of the
case containing his field-glasses," Rob remarked
while Tubby, who had just been yawning, sat
up and seemed to be wide awake again.</p>

<p>"That's a fact, Merritt," he chimed in. "If
you don't object, why, we'd like to be told."</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is," replied Merritt,
"I don't know a great deal more than you do,
come to think of it. Grandfather Crawford
comes from old Scotch stock, so he's a canny sort
of an old gentleman. No use of my telling you
about the way he treated my father when he was
a young man and married against the wishes of
his parents, because that you already know. It's
about the paper, also of Steven Meredith you're
curious to hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, go along, please," begged Tubby.</p>

<p>"The paper is a little scrap, he told me, on
which are marked certain directions as how to
find a certain rich gold mine out in our Southwest
country. Grandfather has one-half his paper,
and the other half is lodged in the cover of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>that field-glass case&mdash;if the man is still carrying
it with him."</p>

<p>"That gets more and more queer, I must say,"
grumbled Tubby, looking as though he could not
untangle the knot that was presented to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, if anybody had told it to me," admitted
Merritt, "I'd have made up my mind right away
he was trying to pull the wool over my eyes with
a silly yarn. And yet there was Grandfather
Crawford just as sober as you ever saw anyone,
and vouching for every word of it as true."</p>

<p>"Well, how on earth did the half of the map
or the directions happen to get in that field-glass
case, without Steven Meredith, who carries the
same, knowing a thing about it?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"This deposit was discovered by an old miner
who never worked it, but had samples of wonderfully
rich ore, which he showed my grandfather
at the time he was rescued by my relative from
being tortured by a couple of halfbreeds who
wanted to get the miner's secret. He gave grandfather
the half of the map, and directions he had
on his person, and told him where he would find
the other half."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now it's beginning to look understandable,"
Tubby admitted. "The old miner did that so if
anybody got hold of him they wouldn't be able to
locate the secret mine&mdash;wasn't that it, Merritt?"</p>

<p>"Just what he had in mind," the other told
him, "and of course the injuries received in the
fight carried the miner off eventually, leaving my
grandfather as his sole heir, if he could only lay
hands on the other half of that valuable little
paper, for neither portion alone made any sense.</p>

<p>"Gee! this is getting real interesting&mdash;if true!"
ventured Tubby.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's a straight yarn, never fear," retorted
Merritt without any trace of ill feeling, however,
for no one ever could quarrel with Tubby. "And
just about here is where this man Steven Meredith,
as he calls himself, breaks into the story.
The old miner had told my grandfather that for
security he kept the other half of the chart, and
the directions how to find the treasure, hidden
in the lining of the case holding a pair of field-glasses
that he had carried for years, as they
were of a special make and considered extra
fine."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>"And when your esteemed relative came to
make a hunt for the said glasses," remarked
Tubby, anxious to show that he was following
the narrative closely, "why of course he found
that Steve had got away with them&mdash;is that the
stuff, Merritt?"</p>

<p>"Great head, Tubby," chuckled the other, as if
amused at this unexpected smartness on the part
of the stout boy. "You've said it, after a fashion;
for that was what really happened. The
glasses were supposed, along with other things
owned by the old miner, to be in the charge of
an old and invalid sister in a small town. To
that place my grandfather went, armed with a
paper which would give him possession of the
traps of the dead man, including the case with
the glasses. And that was where he came up
against a staggering disappointment.</p>

<p>"It seemed that this sister of the miner was
a little queer in her head. When a visitor
chanced to examine the glasses, and offered her
a pretty fine sum for them, she, not knowing
how her brother valued them because of their as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>sociation
with his prospecting life, thought it a
good chance to dispose of some useless property.</p>

<p>"And so the wonderful half of the chart was
gone. My grandfather took enough interest in
the matter to learn that a man by the name of
Steven Meredith possessed the glasses. He even
started a search for him, thinking that he might
be able to buy the glasses back, so as to satisfy
his mind about the worth of the chart.</p>

<p>"Later on he learned that some valuable ore
had been struck in the region where the secret
mine of the dead prospector was said to be located.
This kept making him take more and
more interest in the finding of Steven and the
lost paper. He became absorbed in the hunt,
and in the end had three men on the track.</p>

<p>"They traced Meredith across the ocean. All
sorts of strange rumors came back as to what
he really was. Once it was even said that he was
secretly in the pay of the German Government.
Anyway, he went to Berlin, and was known to
meet with certain men high up in the Secret
Service there.</p>

<p>"Just a little while ago my grandfather re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>ceived
positive word from one of his agents that
Steven Meredith was stationed in a Belgian
town, though what his business there could be
was a mystery. This little town was an obscure
one near Brussels, where he could keep in the
background. Its name is Sempst; and that's
where we are headed now."</p>

<p>"But just explain one queer thing, won't you,
please, Merritt?" asked Tubby.</p>

<p>"I know what you're going to say," replied
the other. "Of course you're wondering why
my relative didn't wire his agent about the glasses,
and offer him a good sum to get them, with
the case. Well, the fact is he didn't have as
much faith in his agents as all that."</p>

<p>"You mean that if the man knew he valued
the article so much he would begin to smell a
rat, and perhaps examine the lining of the case
himself, after he had managed to steal or buy the
glasses?" suggested Rob.</p>

<p>"That's what he had in mind," Merritt continued.
"So he hardly knew what to do, or whom
to trust, until I asked him to send me, and let
me have you along. They didn't like the idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>of us boys starting over here when things were
so upset; but grandfather believes Boy Scouts
can do almost anything. So it came about. And
in a nutshell that's the strange story."</p>

<p>"Gee! you'd think it a page from the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>," Tubby declared. "But queer things can
happen to-day just as much as ever. I only hope
that if we do manage to rake in that old field-glass
case, and the paper is still nestling underneath
the lining, it doesn't turn out to be a pipe
dream&mdash;something that old miner just hatched
up to make himself feel he was as rich as a Vanderbilt."</p>

<p>"We'll have to chance that," said Rob. "Our
part of the business will be done when we carry
the case back to Merritt's grandfather. It's up
to him for the rest. But don't you think we'd
better try and get to sleep, for it's growing late?"</p>

<p>They determined that this was a wise suggestion,
and shortly afterward not only Tubby and
Merritt, but Rob as well had lost all realization
of trouble and stress in sound slumber.</p>

<p>The night passed, and with the coming of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>dawn the boys were astir. Nothing had apparently
happened during the night to disturb them.</p>

<p>In the morning hens were beginning to cackle,
and cows to low, as the boys awoke and crawled
from the hay. A few minutes later, at a nearby
pump, they washed the last bit of drowsiness
from their eyes; after which they began to think,
from the pleasant odors in the air, that it was
nearly time for breakfast.</p>

<p>"I dreamed about that grand paper hunt you
told us about, Merritt," Tubby announced, as
with his chums he sauntered over to the inn to
see what chance there was for getting something
to eat. "And talk to me about your will-o'-the-wisps,
or what they call jack-o'-lanterns, such as
flit around graveyards or damp places nights,
that certainly did beat the record. Lots of times
I was just stretching out my hand to grab it
when I'd hear a laugh, and Steve, he'd snatch
the old field-glass case away. I woke up still on
the trail, and as set as ever to win out."</p>

<p>"Let's hope that will prove to be the case with
us," ventured Rob cheerily.</p>

<p>They found that they were to be given break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>fast;
and as all of the boys had a ferocious appetite
they soon did justice to the meal set before
them.</p>

<p>It was while they were finishing that they
suddenly became aware of the fact that something
along the line of a battle had broken out
not a great ways off. The first intimation they
had of this was the deep-throated sound of a
heavy gun. It made them jump; and the entire
village seemed to become aroused at once, as people
began to run this way and that, chattering
like magpies, some of their faces turning white
with apprehension of what was to come.</p>

<p>They had heard of the fate of Louvain, and
dreaded the hour when the German army should
come sweeping with irresistible force across that
section of the country.</p>

<p>Quick on the heels of that opening gun came
other sounds&mdash;the long roll of rifle firing in volleys,
and the faint cheers of charging men. The
boys even fancied they could hear amidst all the
confusion the loud singing that was said to mark
the advance of the German legions as they went
into battle chanting the "Watch on the Rhine."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>Rob could well believe it, for he knew singing
was to the Teuton mind what the bagpipes meant
to Scotch Highlanders, or cheers to American
boys in khaki.</p>

<p>It was evident that the gallant little Belgian
army, determined to resist to the uttermost the
passage of the Germans across their territory in
the direction of Antwerp and Ghent, had again
given battle to overwhelming numbers.</p>

<p>Of course the boys had rushed out of the inn
and immediately sought the best position from
which they could see something of what was going
on. Many of the villagers were clustered
there, gazing with deepest concern at the section
where the smoke of battle was beginning to
spread like a pall over the country.</p>

<p>"Oh! what is that up there, and heading this
way?" Tubby suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p>No sooner had Rob turned his gaze aloft than
he was able to give the desired information.</p>

<p>"That is one of the famous German Zeppelins,
hovering over the battlefield," he told Tubby.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE BATTLE FOR THE TRENCHES.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>By this time everyone was gazing in mixed
wonder and awe at the strange dirigible balloon,
speeding in great circles far up toward the
clouds.</p>

<p>Rob and his comrades had read more or less
about these monster airships which the German
Count had invented, and which were expected to
play a prominent part in this world war. They
had even hoped that before they left Belgium
they might be given an opportunity to see one of
the fleet monsters, which were said to be able to
carry dozens of men, as well as tons of explosives,
incredible distances.</p>

<p>In Antwerp there had been considerable talk
concerning the possibility of these Zeppelins
making a concerted attack on the city, and forcing
its surrender. All manner of fearful stories
were going the rounds, and many timid people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>had even left the city on the Scheldt for the
more hospitable shores of England, just on account
of the threatening peril from the clouds.</p>

<p>"So, that's a real Zeppelin, is it?" Tubby remarked,
as they stood there with their eyes riveted
on the flittering monster of the air.</p>

<p>"No question about it," Merritt told him, "because
the poor Belgians don't own such an expensive
airship, though they have some aëroplanes,
I was told."</p>

<p>"But what do you reckon they're doing up
there?" asked Tubby, still seeking to increase
his limited stock of knowledge.</p>

<p>"Why," Rob replied, "don't you see there's a
battle going on below, and from that height men
with glasses can see every little thing that's happening.
They are able to tell how the Belgian
forces are intrenched; and by means of signals
let their gunners know where to drop shells so
as to do the most harm."</p>

<p>"Whee! what won't they do next in modern,
up-to-date fighting?" exclaimed Tubby.</p>

<p>"There have been lots of remarkable surprises
sprung in this war already," Merritt observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>thoughtfully, "but I'm thinking the worst is yet
to come. There never was such a war before in
the history of the world, and it's to be hoped this
one ends in a peace that will last forever."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Rob, greatly impressed by what
he was seeing, "war's going to cost so much after
this that the nations will have to fix up some
other way to settle their differences. About that
Zeppelin, Tubby; don't you see how they might
be able to drop a few bombs on the enemy's
trenches; or where the Belgians have fixed
barbed-wire entanglements to stop the rush of
the charging German troops? Just to think that
here we are really watching a battle that isn't
like one of the sham rights they have every summer
at home. It's hard to believe, boys!"</p>

<p>They were all agreed as to this, and every little
while one of them might be detected actually
rubbing his eyes, as though suspecting he were
asleep and all this were but a feverish dream.</p>

<p>The cannonading grew more and more furious
as the morning advanced. Huge billows of
smoke covered sections of the country, some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>it not more than a mile away from the village
where Rob and his chums had stopped.</p>

<p>"And just to think," said Tubby, with a touch
of sorrow in his voice. "While all this sounds
like a Fourth of July celebration to us, safe as
we are, it spells lots of terrible wounds for the
poor fellows who are in the fight. Why, with
all those big shells bursting, and the shrapnel
too, that you spoke about, Rob, right now I
reckon there are just hundreds of them wanting
to be attended to."</p>

<p>"That's true enough, Tubby, the more the
pity," replied Rob.</p>

<p>"What's this coming up behind us?" called out
Merritt, as loud cheers, together with the rattle
of wheels and the pounding of many horses'
hoofs, were heard on the road they had used on
the previous night.</p>

<p>"Oh! they're going to bombard the village; and
now we'll get it!" gasped Tubby.</p>

<p>"It looks like a battery coming from the direction
of Antwerp, and hurrying to get in action!"
Rob ventured to say, as he discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>that those who were seated on the horses and
on the gun caissons wore the Belgian uniforms.</p>

<p>"Just what it is, Rob," added Merritt excitedly.
"They hear the sound of the guns ahead,
and are crazy to get there. Look at them whip
the horses, would you! And how the animals
run! They smell the smoke of burnt powder,
and it's fairly set them all wild!"</p>

<p>It was indeed a stirring sight to see that battery
come tearing along straight through the
little village, and heading directly toward the
place where the flashing and roaring of battle
seemed fiercest.</p>

<p>The men were all keyed up to a pitch of excitement
that made them forget they were about
to face danger and death. They shouted as they
swept past, and the poor villagers, filled with a
momentary enthusiasm, sent back answering
cries.</p>

<p>Such enthusiasm is always contagious. Why,
even peace-loving Tubby seemed to be infected
with some of it. His eyes glowed, and his breath
came in short puffs, as he watched the guns and
caissons go whirling along until men, horses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>all had vanished down the road in a cloud of
dust.</p>

<p>"Some of those brave fellows will never come
back again, I'm afraid," said Tubby sadly.</p>

<p>"It begins to look as if the artillery arm was
going to be everything in this war," Rob remarked,
as though the sight of those bursting
shells impressed him.</p>

<p>"But what do you suppose all that bombardment
means?" Merritt asked.</p>

<p>"I can only give a guess," the patrol leader
replied. "From all I've read I get the idea that
before the Germans order a charge of their infantry
they pour in a heavy bombardment from
every big gun they can get in line. That makes
it so hot in the trenches that the enemy has to
keep under cover. Then the infantry manages
to get a good start before they are fired on."</p>

<p>"Nothing new about that, I guess," replied
Merritt. "It was done in the battle of Gettysburg,
where Lee used more than a hundred cannon
to bombard, before starting to carry Little
Round-top and Cemetery Hill by assault. I was
just reading about it a few weeks ago in a maga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>zine
article at home. But if those are their tactics,
Rob, we ought to be seeing some movement
of troops pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Yes," the patrol leader admitted, "the gun
fire is slackening right now; and if we had glasses
I expect we could see the infantry starting
forward. Those up in the Zeppelin can watch
every move that takes place."</p>

<p>"All the same I'd rather take my chances down
here," Tubby announced.</p>

<p>"What's that moving away over there, Rob?"
demanded Merritt. "Seems like a gray looking
snake creeping out from the shelter of the
woods. I declare if I don't believe it is a mass
of men charging straight at the Belgian
trenches!"</p>

<p>"The Germans all wear a sort of grayish green
uniform, you know," Tubby declared, "which is
so like the dirt that lots of times you can't tell
the soldiers from the earth half a mile away."</p>

<p>"Look sharp, fellows," said Rob, "because that
is where they're going to shoot their bolt. What
we see is a battalion of infantry charging. Now
watch how they begin to gather momentum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>Yes, and when the gun fire lets up we'll hear the
voices of thousands of men singing as they rush
forward, ready to die for the Fatherland."</p>

<p>They stood there with trembling limbs, and
continued to watch what was developing right
before their eyes. It seemed as though that gray
mass would never cease coming into view. The
whole open space was covered with lines upon
lines of soldiers all pushing in one direction, and
that where the intrenchments of the Belgians
must lie.</p>

<p>"Oh! look! look! they're opening on them with
quick-fire guns, and all sorts of things!" Tubby
exclaimed, in absolute horror. "Why, I can see
lanes cut in the lines of the Germans; but they
always close up, and keep right on! Isn't it terrible?"</p>

<p>"It is sublime!" said Rob; and that tribute to
the unflinching bravery of the German advance
was about the limit of a boy's vocabulary.</p>

<p>"But the plucky little Belgians won't yield an
inch of ground, you see!" cried Merritt. "They
keep pouring in that terrible fire, and mowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>the Germans down, just like they were cutting
wheat on a Minnesota farm."</p>

<p>"How will it all end, I wonder?" said Rob, fascinated,
more than he would have believed possible,
by the panorama that was being unfolded
before his eyes.</p>

<p>"If the ammunition of the Belgian batteries
and Maxims holds out," ventured Merritt, "there
won't be any German army left in this part of
the country. Their best troops are said to be
down in France now, fighting the Allies; but if
these are only second or third class reserves, I
wonder what the really top-notch ones can do in
a battle."</p>

<p>"They're weakening, let me tell you!" Rob
startled the others by saying. "Watch and you'll
see that they don't advance as fast as before.
Perhaps the general in charge has found that
the trenches can't be taken by a direct charge.
They're going to fall back, and let the artillery
start in again! The first part of the terrible battle
is over, for there the Germans begin to scatter,
and run, to get out of range of the Maxims!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>"And the plucky Belgians have won again!"
Merritt declared as though almost tempted to
join in the cries of satisfaction that were beginning
to rise from those of the villagers who
were clustered close by, intensely interested spectators
of the thrilling spectacle just enacted.</p>

<p>"And there's that old Zeppelin still swinging
around up in the sky," remarked Tubby. "For all
the information they were able to signal down,
the Germans couldn't take the Belgian trenches.
When they got the wire entanglements they were
blocked."</p>

<p>"But unless I miss my guess," exclaimed Merritt,
"the Zeppelin will have to get on the run
pretty quick or it'll find there's a little war brewing
in the sky, because I can see a couple of aëroplanes
rising from back of the Belgian lines!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BADGE OF COURAGE AND MERCY.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"It seems like we were to be treated to about
everything there is going in the way of up-to-date
fighting!" said Tubby, who was having some
difficulty in craning his fat neck, to look toward
where the wonderful airship was still making
enormous circles above the battle lines.</p>

<p>"Are you sure they are Belgian aëroplanes?"
asked Merritt, who had been attentively observing
the ascending fliers.</p>

<p>"They came up from behind the line of
trenches," replied Rob, "and that makes it look
as if they couldn't be German machines. Besides,
the invaders all use a model that is called
a Taube, which is different from these."</p>

<p>"But why d'ye suppose they didn't climb up
before now, and tackle that monster Zeppelin,
so as to put it out of business, or chase it off?"
inquired Tubby.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>"They had their reasons, I suppose," he was
told by the patrol leader. "No matter what they
may have been, we're not interested. It's enough
for us to watch what's going to happen from now
on."</p>

<p>"I'll be jiggered if the Zeppelin isn't going to
have it out with them!" exclaimed Merritt. "Did
you see that little puff of what looked like smoke?
They've got some sort of gun aboard, and mean
to try and riddle the aëroplanes with it!"</p>

<p>"Whew! talk to me about excitement, this has
got everything I ever knew beaten by a mile!"
admitted Tubby.</p>

<p>"You notice that both the monoplanes manage
to keep pretty far away from the dirigible," Rob
told them. "And see how they bore up in circles
all the while, too, getting higher right
along."</p>

<p>"What's the idea of that?" asked Merritt.</p>

<p>"For one thing it'll put them on equal terms
with the Zeppelin so that they can send back shot
for shot," explained the other. "But unless I
miss my guess they mean to try a bigger scheme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>than that, if once they can get above the airship."</p>

<p>"You mean drop a bomb down on it, don't you,
Rob?" Merritt asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. You know these Zeppelins are made in
many sections. They say one could keep afloat
even if a dozen of these were smashed. They're
along similar lines as the watertight compartments
of steamships. Some auto tires are made
the same way too. But if a bomb was dropped
on top of the gas bag, I reckon the explosion
would play hob with the whole business."</p>

<p>They stood there and watched the strange duel
in the heavens. The thrill of that occasion would
never be forgotten by any one of the three scouts.
And all the while the guns over beyond the low-lying
hills were beating a terrible tattoo that
was like the music of the orchestra when a play
is being performed. That tragedy was there
above them, the stage being the limitless expanse
of the heavens.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin maneuvered again and again in
order to get in touch with the wasp-like enemies
that constantly darted out of reach. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>more or less firing going on, the boys could see,
even though the distance and the growl of the
German artillery prevented them from hearing
any reports.</p>

<p>"There, I believe they've done it!" shouted
Merritt suddenly.</p>

<p>"The Zeppelin is running away, that's sure!"
echoed Tubby, "and one of the aëroplanes seems
to be further up, too!"</p>

<p>"Something has happened, because the rear of
the dirigible looks as if it had collapsed," Rob
announced. "I wonder how they manage to
steer, with the rudder useless. But they're coming
down fast now, you notice!"</p>

<p>"And aiming so as to bring the monoplanes
over the German lines," added Merritt. "If the
little fellows know what's good for them, they'll
keep a good distance off, because there are guns
made that can shoot straight up for a mile, and
send a shell or shrapnel to burst, and fetch an
aviator every time."</p>

<p>While they watched, the disabled Zeppelin
dropped out of sight back of the woods, and it
was easily possible for the boys to hear the wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>shouts of derision that ascended from the
trenches where the Belgians lay concealed.</p>

<p>The two aëroplanes then started to have a little
scout of their own, and doubtless those daring
air pilots picked up more or less information that
would prove of value to the defenders of the
trenches.</p>

<p>"Is the battle over, do you think?" asked Tubby,
when this exciting panorama in the upper
air currents had come to an end.</p>

<p>"Some of the guns are still muttering," Rob
told him, "but they seem to be further away.
Perhaps the Germans are bombarding some fortified
place off in the distance, or it may be an
English army has shown up, and is giving battle
to the Kaiser. You know the poor Belgians are
hoping for that to happen right along."</p>

<p>"But just think what is over there!" continued
Tubby, with a shudder as he pointed a chubby
finger toward the scene of the late charge and
repulse. "Why, I can see hundreds of men
lying around, just like the corn when they go
to cutting so it can be stacked. Ugh! it's awful
to think of all those poor Germans!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<p>"They're not all Germans, either," corrected
Merritt; "because I saw one place where the
Belgians rushed out of their trenches, and fought
hand to hand. Lots of them must have been
knocked over, too. They just couldn't hold back,
I guess, with the fighting spirit in them."</p>

<p>"And this is what's going on all through Belgium,
Northern France, and over along the border
of Russia," said Rob, powerfully impressed
with the tragic scene he had looked upon.</p>

<p>"Here's another battery coming along the
road, too late to get in the fight!" they heard
Tubby saying.</p>

<p>"That's where you're barking up the wrong
tree, Tubby," Merritt assured him, "because
what's coming now is just the opposite of a battery.
One cuts down the ranks of the enemy,
this one helps to bind up their wounds, and carry
them off the battlefield! In action the fighting
men become like fiends; but I guess you could
call these angels of mercy!"</p>

<p>"Why, sure enough, I can see the Red Cross
on the wagon!" cried Tubby, evidently pleased
by the discovery. "Then that must be an ambu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>lance,
and they're going on the battlefield to
help the poor wounded fellows! Oh! how much
I admire them right now. I wish I was worth
a continental as a surgeon, and I'd like to volunteer
to help take care of some of the wounded."</p>

<p>"There are three more ambulances, and they
seem to have several nurses aboard each one,"
Rob observed, as the procession advanced closer
to where they were located.</p>

<p>"There's a man driving, and I reckon now
that may be the surgeon," Merritt was saying,
as though deeply interested. "How about this,
Rob? I thought nurses only worked in the hospitals
back of the lines; but these seem heading
right for the battlefield."</p>

<p>"As a rule they let men bring in the wounded,"
said Rob. "But sometimes a nurse is allowed
to go about trying to help the poor fellows as
best she can until such time as a stretcher can
reach them. Most of them are parched with
thirst, and what they ask for first of all is a
drink of water."</p>

<p>"I might do that much, anyway," Tubby was
heard to mutter to himself, "if only I thought I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>could stand the terrible sights. You know, seeing
blood always used to make me feel faint-like.
But then a scout ought to overcome that
weakness."</p>

<p>Possibly it may have been something in what
Tubby said that gave Merritt his brilliant idea,
for he immediately whirled upon the patrol
leader, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Rob, why couldn't we ask them to take us
along, and let us do what we can to help? As
scouts we know something about taking care of
wounds, you remember. Why, didn't that officer
compliment us on the way we looked after his
men, and the German spy they'd captured? Rob,
see if we could do it, won't you? It might be
a terrible experience for us; but I feel like I'd
be better satisfied if I could lend a helping hand
here."</p>

<p>The first of the three army ambulances had
by this time come close to the boys. Attracted
by their khaki uniforms, and possibly their bright
eager faces, the man who was driving held up
his team. A woman of middle-age, garbed as
a nurse, jumped to the ground, and approached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>the boys. They saw that undoubtedly she must
be the one in charge of the Red Cross detachment.</p>

<p>At sight of the little American flag which
Tubby wore on the lapel of his coat her eyes
glistened.</p>

<p>"That is a glorious sight to my eyes in this
foreign land," she told them, "for I, too, am
American-born. My profession is that of a
trained nurse. A wealthy patient I brought
abroad died in Antwerp; and as the war had
broken out I determined to offer my services to
the Government, so that I was immediately given
a position of trust and responsibility. We are
short-handed with men, you can see. I happen
to know what Boy Scouts over in America have
to learn about taking care of wounded persons.
It is a terrible thing to ask, but this is a case
of necessity. Would you be willing to help us
out; and do you think you could stand the awful
sights and sounds of the battlefield?"</p>

<p>Rob and Merritt exchanged glances; while
their flushed faces told the nurse what their an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>swer
would be, even before they spoke a single
word.</p>

<p>"We were just wondering whether you would
let us join you," Rob said quickly, "for we want
to do something to help those poor fellows over
there. Yes, if you can make room for us aboard
your ambulance we'll gladly go along."</p>

<p>Poor Tubby had lost all his color. He was
as white as a ghost; but with tightly shut teeth
he pushed up, to allow the nurse to fasten a
bit of muslin, stamped with a vivid red cross,
upon his left arm, and then he climbed into the
ambulance.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE FIGHTING WAS OVER.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The horses had been urged on at considerable
speed, in order to arrive upon the scene of action,
for the animals began to show evidences of exhaustion
long before they reached a position
back of the Belgian trenches. That may have
been one of the reasons why they were halted
temporarily, at the time the head nurse talked
with the three Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>As they approached the battle line Rob and
his friends became intensely interested. They
saw the heads of the defenders of the trenches
thrust up to observe their coming, and heard the
hearty ringing cheers with which the Red Cross
nurses were greeted.</p>

<p>Men sprang out to assist them, so that apparently
it would be no hard task to find plenty of
recruits to handle the stretchers upon which the
wounded could be carried to the hastily con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>structed
field hospital in the rear, where the
surgeons would soon be busily employed.</p>

<p>Tubby was still looking very white, but he
had made up his mind that he would go through
with this wonderful experience even if he fainted
dead away. All that was stubborn in his nature
had come to the surface; and Rob, after noticing
this, made up his mind Tubby was going to take
a long step forward before another sun had set.</p>

<p>Now they were on the other side of the
trenches. There was considerable bustle.
Nurses commenced to spread out over the field,
on which some men lay groaning and others very
still.</p>

<p>The assistants with the stretchers, upon whose
arms had been fastened badges bearing the
sacred red cross, began to carry off such of the
wounded as they found needed urgent attention.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys, let's see where we can help
out!" said Rob, trying to appear perfectly cool
and collected, but at the same time knowing that
his knees were inclined to knock together, so
that he could not blame poor Tubby for feeling
as he did.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>They started out. At first all of them stuck
together, for the sights they soon saw filled them
with a sense of horror, as well as compassion.</p>

<p>Never were Boy Scouts placed in a position
where they had more reason to be thankful for
what little knowledge of surgery they had attained.</p>

<p>The American nurse may have felt considerable
doubt as to whether she had done a wise
thing in affording these boys a chance to assist
the Red Cross upon the battlefield. Rob saw that
she hovered near them, as though keeping an eye
on what they did.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful experience for those boys, to
be thus brought in close contact with the dead
and the dying; they could never forget what they
saw there that day.</p>

<p>Even Tubby braced up when he found that he
could be useful in helping the others. He had
secured a bucket of water, and when he heard
some poor fellow cry out, or saw him make frantic
gestures, it was his business to hurry over
and supply his wants. No matter what uniform
the wounded man wore, it did not make a bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>difference; since the Red Cross recognizes
neither friend nor foe, but treats all alike.</p>

<p>It is possible to get accustomed to almost anything
in this world. Not one of those boys would
have imagined a short time before this that they
could find courage and nerve enough to walk in
the midst of such carnage; and yet they were
actually doing it now.</p>

<p>As Rob and Merritt finished binding up the leg
of a poor fellow who would soon have bled to
death but for their coming, the nurse who had
meanwhile come up behind them commended
their work.</p>

<p>"It was excellently done, I want you to know,"
she told them, "and I can plainly see that I need
have no further fears concerning your ability to
be of much assistance here. Do all you can, my
brave boys, but remember not to go too far. You
are not accustomed to such sights, and it may
affect you in the end."</p>

<p>She hurried away to take up her own labors,
leaving the boys with a proud sense of having
done their duty as genuine scouts should, trying
to be of use to others in sore need.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>For an hour, yes two of them, they continued
to work there, while the stretcher bearers and
the ambulances bore the victims of the late conflict
back in apparently an unending procession.
Those poor fellows who had no further need of
attention were of course allowed to remain just
as they had fallen; and by degrees the wounded
were weeded out, to be taken care of back of the
desperately defended lines, where the Red Cross
floated from the canvas field hospital.</p>

<p>Tubby had about reached the end of his endurance.
They could see that he was certainly
getting very wabbly on his feet, for often he
stumbled as he moved around with his bucket and
dipper, seeking a stray wounded soldier who
might have been overlooked, so as to supply
water to quench his raging thirst.</p>

<p>The sun looked down from a cloudless September
sky, and it was very hot for the advanced
season of the year. Far off in the distance those
never-ceasing German guns still kept up their
muttering as they sent shells into some fortified
place. The battle in this particular field was apparently
not going to be renewed; for already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>some of the Belgian batteries were being taken
away, to face a new quarter where, according to
their air scouts, the enemy meant to next try a
forward movement.</p>

<p>Terrible though the experience may have been
to all the boys, none of them had any regrets.
The grateful looks and words they had received
repaid them tenfold for all the nerve-racking
ordeals through which they had gone.</p>

<p>"I think it's queer, though," Merritt was saying
to Rob, as they walked around in search of
any wretched victim whom they might assist,
"that not a single German has been out on the
battlefield to render first aid. I don't understand
it at all. They've got as fine surgeons as
any in the world, and the Red Cross works with
their armies the same as with all the rest."</p>

<p>"I was bothering my head about that, too,
since you mention it," Rob announced.</p>

<p>"What did you make up your mind was the
cause of it?" continued Merritt, who had considerable
respect for the opinions and decisions
of the Eagle Patrol leader.</p>

<p>"It means either one of two things," he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>told. "It may be the settled policy of the Germans
in their rush to push through Belgium and
Northern France to leave their wounded to be
taken care of by the enemy, whenever the battle
has gone against them; or else a quick change of
front compels them to abandon the field."</p>

<p>"Still," argued Merritt, who secretly was much
in favor of the Allies, "you'd think there would
be some parties out with stretchers, looking up
their wounded. I never will understand it."</p>

<p>"Well, they must have a good reason for acting
that way," Rob told him. "You know the
Germans are great sticklers for sacrificing everything
to the good of the cause of the Fatherland.
If necessary even the wounded must be temporarily
neglected until the end aimed at is attained.
You remember what we heard in Antwerp
about those three British cruisers that were
just torpedoed in the North Sea by German submarines?"</p>

<p>"I can see what you mean, Rob. One was
struck, and began to sink. The other two hurried
up to render assistance, and while their engines
were still they were hit by torpedoes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>went down. If, instead of trying to help their
distressed comrades in the English way, they had
let them look out for themselves, and first of all
smashed the conning towers of the submarines,
they would have saved themselves. I guess in
war times the German style counts best, though
it seems cruel to me."</p>

<p>"I think we had better pull out of this before
long," remarked Rob.</p>

<p>"Well, if you asked me I'd say I've had enough
to last the rest of my life," Merritt told his chum.
"If ever I had any idea I'd like to be a soldier
I give you my word that's gone glimmering now.
What I've looked on this day has cured me."</p>

<p>"I was thinking more of poor Tubby than
either of us," the patrol leader remarked. "You
can see he's pretty near the end of his rope.
Twice now I've seen him trip and fall flat, over
some of the war material that's scattered around
so thick. And he could hardly get on his feet
again, he's that played out."</p>

<p>"But, Rob, Tubby has certainly shown up
splendidly in this terrible trial!"</p>

<p>"He's done a heap more than we have," Rob
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>asserted, "because he always has been a timid
sort of chap with regard to seeing blood when
any of us got hurt. I remember how ghastly
white Tubby grew that time one of the scouts
in the Owl Patrol cut his foot with the ax. I
thought for a while we'd have two patients on
our hands. He had to sit down so as to get
over it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and see what he's stood to-day," said
Merritt. "Many a boy who boasts of having lots
of nerve would have shrunk from doing what he
has. Tubby's all right, and that's a fact. But
it's high noon, and I warrant you he's feeling
mighty hungry."</p>

<p>"He would, under ordinary conditions," said
Rob, "but just now I don't believe any of us could
eat a mouthful. I know the very thought of it
makes me feel queer."</p>

<p>"That's because we're not used to such sights
and sounds," Merritt explained. "I expect to
wake up many a night with a groan and a shiver,
dreaming I'm on a battlefield again, after those
awful Maxims have been doing their murderous
work."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, we might take one last turn around,"
suggested Rob, "and if we fail to find any more
wounded men, we'll call it a day's work, and
quit."</p>

<p>"For one thing, I'm glad I don't mean to follow
this up as a profession," his comrade continued.
"I think I've had enough experience of
fighting to last me a lifetime, and yet, on second
thought, if it should happen again that they needed
what little help I could give, why I'd have to
pitch in."</p>

<h3>AN IMPORTANT CLUE.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"There was one thing I meant to mention to
you, Merritt," said Rob, as they once more started
to zigzag across the field where so many
windrows of fallen Germans lay, just as they had
dropped when making that daring charge.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a little strange how the boys
could come to converse as they did while surrounded
by such gruesome sights; but after several
hours' familiarity with such scenes these begin
to lose some of their harrowing features.
And while Rob and his chum were still shocked
by frequent sights, they did not feel the same
weakness that had, in the beginning, almost overpowered
them.</p>

<p>"Then, tell it now," urged Merritt.</p>

<p>"It was about Anthony," continued the other.</p>

<p>"Well, as we know only one Anthony just
now," pursued Merritt, "I reckon you must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>referring to our late guide, the same who gave
us the slip like a coward. What about Anthony,
Rob?"</p>

<p>"I guessed right about him," replied the patrol
leader. "It was not fear that tempted him
to leave us in the lurch, but a craze to get in
action. I think Anthony, while too old a man
to be on the active list of the Belgian army, must
have been a reservist."</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me so," said Tubby, coming up
and catching what was being said by his chums.</p>

<p>"Well," Rob continued, "apparently he knew
where to go to get a suit, for there he was as big
as life, and he even had the audacity to wave
his hand at me, and grin."</p>

<p>"Where was this, Rob?" demanded Merritt,
surprised, as well he might be.</p>

<p>"Where but sitting on one of those ammunition
caissons that went whirling past us into
action. Anthony must have been with the artillery
corps. He felt the longing come over
him when he thought of the enemies of his country&mdash;those
raiding Uhlans. So what did he do
but take French leave on his horse, and get to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>where this battery was waiting for orders to
proceed to the front."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, if you're dead sure it was Anthony,"
Merritt observed, as if mollified by the
information, "of course we'll have to forgive
him. I was only mad because I thought the
fellow'd gone and gotten cold feet, after taking
our advance pay, too. If he's that kind of a
patriot, I've got no quarrel with Anthony."</p>

<p>"And perhaps he even had a share in mowing
down some of these Germans who had invaded
his country," suggested Tubby. "Anthony
seemed to be pretty bitter against the
Kaiser and his people for trying to cross Belgium
in order to strike France in the back, as he
called it. Whee! I'm tired; but I didn't give
up, did I, fellows? You never thought Tubby
would be able to come through with what he has,
and I know it."</p>

<p>"You deserve a medal, Tubby; and we were
just saying what a change there's been in you,"
Rob told him, causing a wan smile to flit across
the wearied face of the fat scout.</p>

<p>"Yes," added Merritt readily, "to see the ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>der
way you handled that German, hardly more
than a boy himself, and who may never live to
see his people again, anyone would have thought
you had it in you to be a surgeon. Tubby, if I
were you I'd pay more attention to such things.
I honestly believe there's a streak of it in your
blood."</p>

<p>"Well," Tubby remarked complacently, "we've
had eminent doctors in our family; and my folks
always said they hoped I'd take a fancy that
way; but when I found how weak I was every
time I saw a little blood, I gave up the idea. Now
I've had my baptism on the battlefield, so mebbe
I <i>will</i> change my mind. Even a soft-hearted
fellow might make a good doctor, if he couldn't
be a surgeon."</p>

<p>"Listen, there's someone calling to us!" exclaimed
Merritt.</p>

<p>"And in German, too," added Rob. "Look all
around, and see if you can find him. He must
have recovered his senses after we passed by
before."</p>

<p>"There's something moving under that pile of
bodies," remarked Tubby with a shudder; "yes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>and now you can see a hand waving to us. Oh!
let's hurry and get the poor fellow out!"</p>

<p>The others were just as willing, and soon they
had dragged a man out from the weight that
had almost smothered him.</p>

<p>"He's pretty badly hurt, I reckon," remarked
Rob, as he immediately stooped down over the
Bavarian soldier, "but not fatally, I think. We'll
do what we can for him here, and the next time
men come along with a stretcher, we'll send him
over to the field hospital."</p>

<p>The wounded German soldier had listened to
them speaking.</p>

<p>"Are you American boys, then?" he asked, in
excellent English.</p>

<p>"Well, now, he must have guessed that when
you said you 'reckoned,' Rob," declared Merritt,
"but how comes it you talk English, my
friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm from Hoboken," said the man, smiling
in spite of the terrible pain he must have been
enduring.</p>

<p>Rob was already busily engaged stanching
the bleeding from his wounds, which seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>be numerous, though not apt to prove fatal, if
they had proper attention.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Hoboken, New Jersey?" he
asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Sure. I have lived there for many years
now, and have a large brewing interest. Krauss
is my name, Philip Krauss. I went across from
Munich, in Bavaria, and was on a visit to my
old home when the war came about. Although
I have long been an American citizen I still love
my native land, and they soon found a place for
me in the ranks. But now if I ever get over
this I think I will have had enough of fighting,
and expect to return to my wife and children
in Hoboken. But what are you doing here on
this terrible field? It is not the place for boys."</p>

<p>"We are Boy Scouts," Tubby informed him
proudly. "By accident we were where we could
watch the battle being fought. Then along came
the Red Cross ambulances, and the nurses. They
asked us to assist, and as scouts all learn something
about first aid, why we thought we'd help
out. I guess you're about our last case, Herr
Krauss."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile Rob and Merritt busied themselves.
The way they went about temporarily
relieving his suffering, as well as stopping the
loss of blood, quite won the admiration of the
Hoboken patriot, even as it had done in the case
of numerous other wounded men whom the boys
attended previously.</p>

<p>It chanced that once again the boys became
immersed in their own affairs, which were beginning
to weigh heavily on their minds.</p>

<p>"I was making inquiries of one of the men
with the stretchers," Rob told his comrades, "and
he assured me that this little place by the name
of Sempst is only a matter of six miles or so
from where we are right now."</p>

<p>"Then," said Merritt, brightening up, "if only
we stand a chance to get around without being
gobbled by the Germans, we might strike in
there to-morrow, and see if Steven Meredith is
still at his post. The agent sent word to my
grandfather that he had accepted a position
there in charge of some manufacturing plant
owned by a German firm in Brussels. I think
myself there may have been some truth in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>story about his being in the pay of the German
Government, both over in America and here!"</p>

<p>The wounded man was listening eagerly to
what they said.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he now broke in. "But that is
not a common name; and I once met a Steven
Meredith, who pretended to be an American citizen,
but who I knew was an agent of the German
Government. It may be the same man. I
entertained him, together with the German consul
in New York City, at my home in Hoboken.
Do you happen to know any peculiarity about
his looks or manner that would identify him?"</p>

<p>"The man we are trying to find was tall," said
Merritt quickly, "and has a slight cast in his left
eye. He talks with something of a twang, as
though he might be a Down-East Yankee."</p>

<p>"It must be the same!" declared Philip Krauss,
as though convinced. "That accent, I believe,
was cleverly assumed for a purpose. Promise
me that you will not think it your duty to betray
him to the enemy, and I will tell you still more
of him."</p>

<p>Merritt and Rob exchanged significant looks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>"We have no fight against either Germany or
the Allies," Merritt observed, "for Americans
are neutral, and there would be no need of our
betraying him, even if we had the chance. So
we can easily give you that promise. He has
something in his possession that belongs to my
family; and we have come a long way to get it;
that is all we want of Steven Meredith. Now,
what can you tell us about him?"</p>

<p>"Only this," replied the wounded Hoboken
brewer. "You have perhaps saved my life, and
I feel I am under heavy obligations for the favor.
It is worth something to my wife and family
that I should live to see Hoboken again. The
man you are looking for is in the suburbs of
Brussels. You spoke of Sempst. He was there
two days ago when my troop passed through.
That may ease your minds, my brave boys."</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling us how you know
this?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"I saw him, and talked with him," came the
convincing response. "He remembered me,
though he put his finger on his lips, and looked
around him as though he were suspicious. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>is, as you said, in charge of a manufacturing
plant, or appears to be, though he may have
been sent there to spy upon the people, and learn
valuable facts for the service. But I am glad
to be able to do even a little in return for your
kindness."</p>

<p>As two soldiers wearing the Red Cross on their
sleeves came along just then with a stretcher,
the boys beckoned to them, and had Philip
Krauss carried off to the field hospital. They
did not see him again after that. If, however,
they should ever reach home again, they determined
some day to look the Hoboken man up,
and learn of his further adventures.</p>

<h3>THE CAMP FIRES OF AN ARMY.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Here, it's getting well along into the afternoon,"
remarked Tubby with a forlorn look on
his face, "and I'm so knocked out that if you
told me you meant to make a start for the little
Belgian town right away I'd faint, sure I would."</p>

<p>"Don't think of doing it, then, Tubby," Rob
told him, "because the rest of your chums are
feeling in pretty much the same box themselves."</p>

<p>"We've had a terribly hard day of it, for a
fact," agreed Merritt, as he looked around upon
the scene, and shuddered in spite of his well
known nerve.</p>

<p>"Then please tell me what's the program?"
pleaded the fat scout. "That munch of black
bread was good enough to keep a fellow from
starving to death; but I certainly do hope there's
a better prospect ahead of us for supper."</p>

<p>"Rob, you've got a scheme!" asserted Merritt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>"What makes you think so?" asked the other,
smiling languidly; for he was very nearly exhausted
from the hard work he had done acting
as an assistant field surgeon in the service of
the Red Cross corps, doing temporary work in
binding up wounds, and giving stimulants to
those who were weak through loss of blood.</p>

<p>"Oh! I can tell it from the way you act," replied
Merritt. "I haven't been your closest chum
all this time without getting to know what different
things mean. Now give us a pointer;
what about getting some supper, and finding a
place to sleep to-night?"</p>

<p>"Well, do you think you could stand for another
night in the hay?" demanded Rob.</p>

<p>"Just try me, that's all!" whimpered Tubby.
"And, say, if you're thinking of going back to
that village again, I only hope they'll be good to
us, and feed us like they did this morning."</p>

<p>"That's what I had in mind," the patrol leader
told them. "So the sooner we make a start that
way the sooner we can rest up."</p>

<p>It was weary work tramping all the way back
to the little village where they had first met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>the ambulances of the Red Cross corps, and
joined hands with the workers. Rob would have
liked to say good-by to the American nurse who
had taken so much interest in their welfare. He
knew, though, that it would be too much for
Tubby to approach that terrible field hospital,
where undoubtedly the nurses were still busily
engaged helping the surgeons in their labors.</p>

<p>Whenever Tubby groaned and gave signs of
dropping, they called a temporary halt and, in
this way, made it as easy for the fat scout as
possible.</p>

<p>Somehow the very thought of that sweet-scented
hay appealed to Tubby very nearly as
much as a good feed might; and that was saying
a great deal.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder at hoboes liking haystacks
when they're wandering around the country, if
only they're as nice as that mow we struck," he
told the others more than once. "Why, things
couldn't be better. Now I understand what they
mean when they say 'hitting the hay.' It means
a sweet sleep. But we're really getting there,
ain't we, Rob?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>"We're right on top of the village now,
Tubby," Merritt told him.</p>

<p>"Yes," added Rob, "there you can see the elevation
we stood on when we watched the terrible
battle. The village is here on our left. One
more tug, and we'll arrive, so brace up, Tubby."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm getting along quite decent, thank
you, Rob. But I'll be glad when we're sitting
on that bench under the shade of the tree."</p>

<p>As they entered the village they found that
it was quite a different place from the time of
their previous visit. Streams of wounded men
had been brought in, and every other cottage
was turned into a temporary hospital.</p>

<p>Of course the injured Belgians were given the
first choice, as was perfectly natural; but Rob
was pleased to see that after all these humble
villagers had human traits in their make-up.
Misery makes the whole world akin, and although
they had no reason to love any German
invader, the sight of stalwart young Teutons
suffering agonies touched many a mother's heart;
their own sons might any day be in need of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>same attention from strangers, and they could
not refuse to aid these wounded foes.</p>

<p>So into many a Belgian home a sorely stricken
German was carried, to be cared for until the
time came when he could be removed, either to
his own lines, or to Antwerp.</p>

<p>The boys first of all sought that shady spot
where the bench mentioned by Tubby offered an
inviting seat. Here they sat down, and observed
the many stirring sights that were taking place
all around them.</p>

<p>"I've seen two men taken to the barn," remarked
Merritt, half an hour later, "and so I
reckon we'll have neighbors in our hay-mow to-night."</p>

<p>Tubby made a grimace, and then seemed to be
ashamed of his selfishness.</p>

<p>"Well, if we do have to play nurse," he observed
with the air of a philosopher, "I suppose
we can stand it. What are all our troubles, I'd
like to know, compared to those these poor people
are suffering?"</p>

<p>"That's right, Tubby," said Merritt, "and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>we'll manage to pick up plenty of sleep, I should
think."</p>

<p>"It'll have to be in the early part of the night,
then," Rob told them, "because we want to get
out of this a couple of hours before daylight."</p>

<p>"You mean to start then for Sempst, do you?"
asked Tubby, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, because it might turn out to be dangerous
work walking in broad daylight, until we've
managed to get around the Germans," Rob explained.
"I've already picked up considerable
information about the country, and the lay of
the land. Between now and the time we turn
in I hope to learn still more, so that I can take
you on a road by starlight that will make a circuit
around the German camps."</p>

<p>Apparently both his mates had the utmost confidence
in Rob's ability to do this, for there was
no word of protest raised. Merritt asked a few
questions, and then they fell back upon their old
occupation of watching the movements of the
villagers, mostly women, as they bustled to and
fro.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Rob sauntered over to the inn, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>had a long talk with the old man who ran the
public house. They could see him doing considerable
pointing, and from this fact judged that
Rob was keeping his word about picking up all
the information possible.</p>

<p>When he came back it was getting near sundown;
and of course the first thing Tubby asked
was:</p>

<p>"Did he say we could have it, Rob?"</p>

<p>As both of the other scouts were so well acquainted
with Tubby's weak points they did not
need a dictionary in order to understand what
was on his mind.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to tell you, Tubby," replied the other,
"that the innkeeper says we deserve the best
supper he can get ready. It seems that they've
been talking about us here. Some of the nurses
must have told how we worked on the battlefield;
or it may be the wounded soldiers mentioned
the fact that we did something to help
them bear up till the stretchers arrived. No matter
what happened, the innkeeper thinks a heap
of us all, and we'll not go to our hay shake-downs
hungry this night!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>"Hurray!" cried Tubby joyfully, "he's certainly
a good fellow, Rob, I tell you; and I'm
never going to forget him. The man who keeps
my body and soul together has my eternal gratitude."</p>

<p>Later on they were called in, and found that
a substantial meal had been prepared for them.
Tubby was fairly ravenous, and his chums found
it necessary to warn him not to founder.</p>

<p>"Remember, we've got to be up and doing by
three in the morning at the latest," Rob observed,
"and if you make yourself sick the whole plan
will be knocked galley-west. We might have to
leave you behind, after all."</p>

<p>That last threat brought Tubby to his senses.</p>

<p>"Why, you see," he explained, as he pushed
himself away from the table and its temptations,
"I was trying to fix it so that in case we had to
go without our breakfast to-morrow I'd be in
shape to stand it."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," mused Merritt, "I think you're
trying to fix it so that you could do without eating
for a week."</p>

<p>When they made their way outside again it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>was to find that night had fallen. In the western
sky a young moon looked down pityingly on the
field which had so lately been marked by the desperate
charge of the German hosts, only to fail
in their effort to break through the Belgian intrenchments
with their barbed wire defenses.</p>

<p>"Look, over there are hundreds of little fires
flickering!" exclaimed Tubby.</p>

<p>"Those are the camp fires of the Germans,"
Rob told him. "I want to fix them in my mind,
because we will have to make a wide detour, so
as to avoid running across any patrol on the
outskirts of their camp. I hope by the time daylight
comes we can be far enough around to get
off without being seen. The worst thing is this
khaki uniform business. If only we had on ordinary
clothes we might be taken for Belgian boys.
But, as it is, they'll think we're soldiers, or at the
least Belgian scouts, and they treat them as if
they were regular enlisted men."</p>

<p>Shortly afterward they again sought the barn.
The lantern once more hung on its accustomed
hook, and by its friendly gleam Rob and his two
chums were enabled to find the place where on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>the preceding night they had slept so well. The
wounded men happened to be removed from them
by some little distance. They could be heard
occasionally groaning, or talking in low tones;
but, as the boys were too tired to remain awake
long, they soon lost all consciousness of what
was passing around them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the crowing of a rooster nearby may
have told Rob that it was in the neighborhood of
three o'clock, for he aroused his chums close to
that time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>THE HANGING BRIDGE.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Do we have to get out at this terribly early
hour?" asked Tubby, as he dug his knuckles into
his eyes, still heavy with sleep.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rob. "I've taken a look at the
stars, and it must be half-past two, or near it.
You know I've made it a practice to be able to
tell the hour of night in that way, and can hit it
every time. Come, get a move on you, Tubby,
unless you'd prefer staying here in the hay and
waiting till we come back."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't shake me that way if I know
it," muttered Tubby, hastening to crawl out of
his snug nest.</p>

<p>The night air was rather chilly, when once
they found themselves outside. All of them were
glad to button up their coats.</p>

<p>Looking in the direction where the myriad of
fires had been burning earlier in the night and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>seeming like innumerable giant fireflies which
they were accustomed to seeing summer evenings
at home, they found that most of them had died
out.</p>

<p>"I expected that would happen," said Rob,
when Merritt called his attention to the altered
conditions in the camp of the Germans, "and it's
lucky I made my plans without depending on
seeing those fires again. I've got other landmarks
to go by."</p>

<p>"I expected you'd have," said Merritt, filled
with the utmost confidence in the leader of the
Eagle Patrol, which faith was founded on a
long list of past performances worth remembering.</p>

<p>As there was nothing to hinder them, they
made an immediate start. Tubby was observed
to cast a last longing look back toward the humble
village inn. No doubt he was deploring the
necessity that compelled them to leave such hospitable
quarters without waiting for breakfast-time
to come along.</p>

<p>It was not exactly dark, once their eyes became
accustomed to conditions. The stars shone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>brilliantly in the clear heavens overhead, and in
open country it is possible to steer one's way
fairly well by starlight.</p>

<p>For some time the boys went on. Tubby, of
course, often stumbled, for it would not have
been Tubby otherwise; but, as he had not so
far actually spread himself face downward on
the road, he thought he was doing very well.</p>

<p>Merritt could see how Rob had laid out their
course, by the assistance of the friendly innkeeper,
who had been told of their desire to reach
the little place called Sempst. He had really
drawn Rob a rude but correct chart of the roads
covering the territory between, and informed
him as to what his best plan of campaign would
be.</p>

<p>A number of times they had slight scares.
Once a dog ran out from a yard and commenced
barking wildly at them, even threatening to nip
Tubby in the leg. It was only natural for the
threatened one to shout angrily and kick desperately
at the offending canine. By great good
luck he managed to land the toe of his shoe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>against the vicious animal's nose, as a loud howl
announced.</p>

<p>"There, that serves you right, for bothering
me, you silly thing!" grumbled Tubby.</p>

<p>The others knew he must be very proud of
that shot, and would often refer to it when complaints
were made afterward to the effect that he
was "slow." Any one who could manage to get
his foot in contact with a snapping dog must not
be reckoned out of the running.</p>

<p>Just what they would do should they finally
reach the small town where Steven Meredith
was supposed to be in charge of a large German
manufacturing plant, they had not as yet determined.
It was Rob's plan to secure possession
of that field-glass case by hook or crook, for, if
it proved impossible to obtain by fair means, then
he meant to try strategy.</p>

<p>For this purpose he had even bought an empty
case while in Antwerp which had been carried
through all their adventures. It was a new
one, for, in making up his plans, Rob may have
had in mind the old Arabian story of the magical
lamp, and how the cunning schemer managed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>get possession of it by going around and offering
housewives to exchange new lamps for old ones.</p>

<p>He meant to exchange with Steven, and give
him a brand new case for his worn one, should
the opportunity arise for such a transfer.</p>

<p>"And once we get our hands on that bit of
paper," he had told the others, "we'll shake the
dust of this country off our shoes in the biggest
hurry ever."</p>

<p>It must have been fully an hour after they left
the stable of the village inn when Rob imparted
some information to his chums that caused
Tubby, at least, more or less apprehension.</p>

<p>"It's about time we were coming to it now,"
Rob started to say.</p>

<p>"What, already?" remarked Tubby, evidently
delighted, for, of course, he foolishly thought it
must be the little town they were heading for that
Rob meant.</p>

<p>The other quickly undeceived him.</p>

<p>"Oh! we're a long, long way off from Sempst
yet, Tubby," he said. "I was referring to a
bridge the inn-keeper told me about, that's all."</p>

<p>"What's there about a bridge to worry us, I'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>like to know?" muttered the fat scout suspiciously,
feeling terribly depressed, because he had been
so like a drowning man grasping at a straw.</p>

<p>"Unless it happens to be guarded by the Germans,"
suggested Merritt softly, "and then we'd
have a dickens of a time getting across."</p>

<p>"The trouble about this particular bridge isn't
so much that it's apt to be guarded," Rob went
on to inform them, "but the inn-keeper was
afraid we'd find it gone!"</p>

<p>"Blown up, do you mean, Rob?" Tubby demanded.</p>

<p>"It's been reported that way," he was informed.
"Fact is, there doesn't seem to be much
doubt about it. From all accounts, the Belgians
destroyed it, as they have done many other costly
bridges, so as to impede the advance of the German
heavy guns. It takes lots of time and trouble
to rebuild a bridge and make it strong
enough to let a monster siege gun rumble over."</p>

<p>"But, Rob, shall we have to swim across, or is
there a sort of ford handy that we might use?"
Merritt inquired.</p>

<p>"I certainly hope we don't have to swim, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>way,"
Tubby declared, "for, if there's one thing
I hate to do, it's to get soaking wet. It's so uncomfortable
afterward, and especially when you
can't change your clothes. But, of course, if it's
got to be done, we'll all have to just grin and
bear it."</p>

<p>"It may not be necessary in this case," added
Rob, no doubt purposely delaying his information,
because he liked to hear Tubby drumming
up his courage in this way.</p>

<p>"Then mebbe you've gone and got some wings
hidden away, which we can use to fly across?"
suggested Tubby quickly, "or it might be an aëroplane
is kept handy so's to ferry folks over dry-shod."</p>

<p>"Neither of your guesses hits the mark, Tubby,"
he was informed. "The inn-keeper said one
man told him that, while the bridge was wrecked,
a few of the steel beams still hung in place, so
that any one who was fairly spry might manage
to make his way over from one side to the other.
A number had done it, including the man who
told him."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>"If others can, we ought to be able to make
it," Merritt said stoutly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose that's so," admitted Tubby
ruefully, "but then you mustn't forget that they
had daylight to help out. That makes a heap of
difference. I never did have the eyes of a cat
so's to see in the dark."</p>

<p>"It's getting on toward the first peep of dawn,"
Rob told him; "and I expect there'll be some light
for us when we reach the bridge."</p>

<p>"We can wait till she comes along, then," Tubby
continued, as though even that assurance gave
him more or less satisfaction.</p>

<p>From the formation of the country Rob judged
they must soon arrive at the place of the bridge.
He had already made the discovery that there
was a stream on one side of them, which the
road would have to cross before long.</p>

<p>"I think I see where it lies," Merritt announced
a few minutes after they had stopped
talking.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the leader, when he had followed
the course of Merritt's outstretched finger
as well as was possible in the semi-darkness, "that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>must be the anchorage of the bridge. We'll soon
know what we're going to be up against."</p>

<p>"Well, all I hope is we don't have to swim,
that's what!" Tubby muttered.</p>

<p>Rob, as they continued to advance, kept a careful
lookout. He wondered whether any sort of
patrol could have been stationed at the ruined
bridge by one or the other of the hostile armies.
It might make considerable difference with them
in their intended crossing; and would turn out
very awkward if, when they were in the middle
of the span, they discovered they were being
made targets by some reckless marksmen on the
further shore.</p>

<p>Presently they drew up alongside the spot. As
Rob had hinted the night was really at an end,
and in the east the first peep of coming dawn
could be seen in the brightening sky.</p>

<p>"It's a wreck, all right!" said Merritt, as they
stood there, straining their eyes to try and follow
the outlines of the torn steel girders that seemed
to have been twisted into all manner of queer
shapes by the force of the explosion.</p>

<p>"Gingersnaps and popguns!" ejaculated Tub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>by
helplessly, "and do you really expect to crawl
over that swinging thing? I've read about some
awful hanging bridges in the mountains of South
America and Africa, but I bet you they couldn't
hold a candle alongside this mussed-up affair.
Whee! you'd have to blindfold me, I'm afraid,
boys, if you expected me to creep out there on
that dizzy girder."</p>

<p>"We'll wait a bit till the light gets stronger,"
Rob counseled, knowing full well that when it
came to it Tubby would summon the necessary
resolution to cross over, especially if his comrades
showed the way.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour elapsed. By that time
they could see across fairly well.</p>

<p>"First of all," Rob summed up, "there doesn't
seem to be anybody over there to bother us, that
I can notice."</p>

<p>"And the way across isn't so bad, that I can
see," announced Merritt, principally to help buoy
up the sinking heart of poor Tubby. "Why, all
of us have done stunts worse than that. You
know we have, Tubby, many a time."</p>

<p>"Well," Tubby answered him weakly, "just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>you say, boys. I'm in your hands. I promise to
do the best I can to get over; but, if I <i>should</i>
slip, please get me out of the river as soon as
you can. You know I'm not a cracking good
hand at swimming."</p>

<p>Of course they promised, and cheered him up
by every means possible; but it was with many
doubts that in the end Tubby consented to start
forth on the trip.</p>

<p>Rob led the way, and after him came the fat
chum, with Merritt bringing up the rear. There
was a method in this arrangement, for, while the
pilot could test each girder, so as to pronounce
it secure, the rear guard was able to keep an eye
on luckless Tubby, and even give him an occasional
word of advice.</p>

<p>Now that the morning had arrived they could
see better with each passing minute; and Rob
soon declared there was no necessity for any further
delay.</p>

<p>It was always a principle with him to grapple
with a difficulty, and carry out his plans, without
letting anything like dismay seize hold of his
heart.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>Accordingly Rob now made a start.</p>

<p>"Why, this is dead easy," was the way he
sung out, after he had passed along the swaying
girder for a little distance. "All you have to
make sure of is that your grip is sound. Then
keep hunching along, foot by foot. And don't
look down any more than you can help, because
it might make you dizzy."</p>

<p>Tubby shut his teeth hard, and began to follow
after the pilot. He made good progress until he
had about reached the middle of the rocking span.
Then Rob was really alarmed to hear a sudden
loud cry, and feel his slender hold shaken violently.</p>

<p>Something had certainly happened to unfortunate
Tubby!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>SCOUT TACTICS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Just as he feared, when Rob managed to turn
around and look back, he found that Tubby had
gone and done it again. Whether he had missed
his footing, or something had given way under
his additional weight, was a question that could
not be decided.</p>

<p>Before Merritt, close in his rear, could thrust
out a helping hand, poor Tubby had fallen. The
river was all of thirty feet below, and just there
the water looked unusually unpleasant, because
it had considerable foam on the surface, there
being a shallow rift above the wider stretch.</p>

<p>By the merest accident in the world, Tubby's
clutching hands had succeeded in fastening upon
a loose steel stay that hung downward for ten
feet. It must have given the fat boy a considerable
wrench when he gripped this, but he had
clung with the tenacity of despair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<p>When Rob turned around, the first thing he
saw was Merritt kneeling there on the violently
agitated girder over which they were making
their crossing. He was staring downward, and,
of course, Rob instantly focused his gaze in the
same quarter.</p>

<p>He had expected to see Tubby splashing about
like a porpoise in the stream far down below;
but, instead, was astonished to discover him
clinging desperately to that loose piece of steel
wreckage.</p>

<p>Tubby had his face turned up toward his
chums. There was not a particle of the rosy
color to be seen that as a rule dyed his ample face;
in fact, he was as white as a ghost. A beseeching
look was in his eyes. Tubby knew that swinging
there he was in a serious predicament, from
which there would be only one escape if he were
left to his own devices. That would mean he
must release his frantic clutch on the swaying
steel rope, and drop down into the river, a possibility
he shuddered to contemplate.</p>

<p>"Hey! get me up out of this, fellows, can't
you?" he whined, for, after his recent gymnastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>efforts, he no longer had sufficient breath to
shout.</p>

<p>"Clasp your legs around the thing, can't you,
Tubby?" said Rob, who saw that the strain on
the other's arms must be tremendous, judging
from the way he was hanging there.</p>

<p>The advice struck Tubby as well worth following;
so he immediately began to work his short
legs violently until he found that he could, as Rob
suggested, twist them around his slender support.</p>

<p>When that had been accomplished it was much
easier for him. He began to suck in some encouragement
once more.</p>

<p>"But won't you try and get me up again, Rob?"
he asked piteously. "I can't hang on here for
very long, like a regular old pendulum to a clock.
I'm not wound up for a seven-day-goer. And
say, I'd hate to have to drop kerplunk into all
that water down there. Think up some way to
grab me out of this, won't you, Rob?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to, Tubby. Keep still a bit, and
let me think," he was told.</p>

<p>In one way, of course, it was a ridiculous sight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>and that was why Rob winked his eye at Merritt
when he thought he could detect a whimsical look
on the other's face. Still, it was anything but a
laughing matter to poor Tubby, who felt that he
had a tremendous amount at stake. Every time
he found himself compelled to let his horrified
eyes turn downward that noisy stream seemed to
be more and more formidable to him. He fairly
hated it.</p>

<p>"Can't you climb up again, Tubby?" asked
Merritt, who knew exactly what he would have
quickly done had he found himself placed in the
same predicament.</p>

<p>"I'd like to, the worst kind," the fat scout assured
him, "but you know I'm feeling very queer
and weak, so I don't believe I could do much
that way, unless," he added quickly, "I had some
assistance from above."</p>

<p>"And that's just what I'm going to try and
give you, Tubby."</p>

<p>While Rob was saying this he had unbuttoned
his coat. This he proceeded to take off, first making
sure to transfer anything he had in the pockets,
so that he might not suffer a loss.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now, by leaning down here, I think I can
reach you with this coat," he proceeded to explain.
"If I had a rope, it would be much easier,
for with a loop I could make a sure thing of it.
But half a loaf is better than no bread, they
say."</p>

<p>"Of course it is, Rob," agreed Tubby, who was
in no position to quarrel with any measures that
were taken for his relief. "But what can I do
with the coat when it comes down to me? I don't
feel that cold, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm going to keep hold of one end, Tubby,"
Rob explained quietly, in a way to convince the
imperiled scout that everything was working as
arranged, and that he need not worry. "With
just one hand you get a good grip of the end
that's near you; then start in to try and climb,
using your clasped legs the best you know how.
And don't get discouraged if you only come up
an inch or so at a time. When you're within
reach Merritt will hang down and lend a hand,
too."</p>

<p>All of which was undoubtedly very cheering to
Tubby. This thing of having stanch comrades
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>in times of distress was, he had always believed,
one of the best parts of the scout brotherhood.</p>

<p>He immediately took a firm grip of the dangling
coat-sleeve, and commenced to wriggle the
best he knew how.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">He immediately took a firm grip&mdash;and commenced to wriggle the best he knew how.&mdash;<a href="#Page_247">Page 247</a>.</span>
</div>


<p><br />"I'm making it, Rob; sure I am!" he presently
announced. "That time I slid up as much as six
inches. It was a bully hunch, that coat racket of
yours. Keep her going, Rob, and I'll get there
yet. Never give up&mdash;that's my motto, you know.
I may get in lots of scrapes, but somehow I always
do manage to crawl out, don't I?"</p>

<p>"Save your breath, Tubby, for your work;
don't chatter so much," Rob told him.</p>

<p>Merritt was ready to do his part. He had
clasped a leg about the girder to help hold him,
and was leaning as far down as possible. Presently
the grunting fat chum reached a place
where he could be taken hold of, and so Merritt
fastened a hand in his coat back of his neck.</p>

<p>"Here you come, Tubby," he said encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Don't let go with your hands or knees yet!"
warned Rob; for, should Tubby be so foolish as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>to do this, the chances were that such a sudden
weight might drag Merritt down, and both would
take the plunge.</p>

<p>It required considerable effort to finally land
Tubby on the horizontal girder, but in the end
this was accomplished. Then all of them sat
there to rest after their recent violent exertions.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I came to do it," Tubby finally
remarked, as though he deemed it necessary that
some sort of explanation were forthcoming. "I
was moving along as nice as you please, when all
of a sudden I felt myself going. I must have
grabbed at the air, and happened to get a grip on
that hanging steel rope. Well, it might have
been a whole lot worse for me! I'm glad I didn't
get soused in the river. And I'll never forget
how nobly my chums came to the rescue."</p>

<p>"Oh! stow that sort of talk, Tubby," Merritt
told him. "That's what we're here for. What's
a scout wearing his khaki uniform for if it isn't
to remind him what he owes to his chums?
You'd do the same for us any old time."</p>

<p>"Just try me, that's all," declared the grateful
Tubby; and then, changing his tune, he went on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>to say: "Here we are, out in the middle of the
span, and it's just as hard to go back as it is to
move forward. So when you're ready, Rob, start
off again. I'll try not to slip any more. The
next time you might see my finish."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it would see mine," remarked Merritt,
rubbing the arm he had used in order to
tug at Tubby's great weight.</p>

<p>Luckily nothing more happened, and they were
able to reach the opposite shore in safety. Tubby
sank down and panted, as soon as he crawled off
the end of that fragment of the steel bridge.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness that job is over with!" he
exclaimed fervently, "and all I hope is that we
don't have to come back this way."</p>

<p>"Oh! you're getting to be an expert tight-rope
walker by now, Tubby," Merritt said encouragingly.
"A little more practice, and you could
apply for a job with Barnum &amp; Bailey's circus."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Merritt, but I have loftier aims
than that calling," said Tubby disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Well, let's be getting on," suggested Rob.
"We've spent enough time here already."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness I don't have to tramp along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>soaked to the skin," Tubby was heard to tell himself,
with gratitude.</p>

<p>The road skirted the river bank on the side
they were now on for some little distance at least.
Rob continued to keep a watchful eye around as
they progressed. He knew there was always
a chance that they might meet some detachment
of troops hurrying along; though the fact of the
bridge being down must be known to the Germans,
and would deter them from trying to make
use of this road until a temporary structure could
be thrown across the river by their engineers.</p>

<p>Most of the inhabitants had fled from that part
of the country. Some may have drifted into
Brussels before the capital fell into the hands of
the invaders, when August was two-thirds gone;
and they had remained there ever since. Others
had fled in the direction of Ghent and Antwerp,
in the hope that these cities might hold out
against the German army.</p>

<p>Several times they saw old men at work in the
fields, trying to save a part of their farm crops,
though without horses they could do little. Every
beast of burden had been drafted for one or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>other army; what the Belgians missed the Germans
had certainly commandeered to take the
place of horses lost in the numerous fierce engagements
thus far fought.</p>

<p>On consulting his little chart Rob soon found
that it would be necessary for them to abandon
this good road, and take to a smaller one that
branched off from it, winding in through the
trees, and past farms that had been thrifty before
this blight fell on the land.</p>

<p>"Here's a wood ahead of us that looks as if it
covered considerable territory, and you don't often
see such a bunch of timber in Belgium," Merritt
announced presently.</p>

<p>"Because, with seven million inhabitants to
such a small area," added Rob, "it's always been
necessary that they employ what is called intensive
farming. That is, they get as much out of
the soil as possible, even to several crops off of
the same patch of ground during the year."</p>

<p>"Belgium is a busy manufacturing country,
too, or has been up to now," Merritt continued,
which information he may have remembered
from his training at school, or else found in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>guide-book purchased in New York City before
their steamer sailed for England.</p>

<p>"I wonder what we'll strike on the other side
of this wood?" Tubby questioned, always speculating
on things to come; and possibly hoping
then and there they might run across a hospitable
farmer who would kindly offer to provide them
with some sort of breakfast.</p>

<p>"That's yet to be seen," Merritt told him.
"Here's where there seems to be a sort of
swampy patch, with water and bogs. Listen to
the frogs croaking, will you? And I can see
more than a few whoppers, too. Chances are
this is a frog farm that supplies the big hotels in
Brussels and Antwerp. You know the French
are keen on frogs' legs, and pay fancy prices for
them by the pound."</p>

<p>"I've eaten them more than once," Rob informed
them, "and I never had spring chicken
that was more toothsome and tender."</p>

<p>Whereupon Tubby cast a wistful eye toward
the border of the frogpond, where the big greenbacks
could be seen, sitting partly in the water,
and calling to one another socially.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>The boys kept walking on, and finally came
to where the trees began to get more scanty.
About this time Rob made a discovery that was
not at all pleasing.</p>

<p>"Hold up, fellows," he said in a hoarse whisper
that thrilled Tubby in particular, "our road
is blocked. There's a whole German army corps
camped ahead of us; and it's either go back, or
else hide here in the woods till they take a notion
to break camp and clear out. Let's drop down
in the brush and talk it over."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FROG HUNTERS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"That settles me, I guess!" said Tubby sadly,
as he followed Rob into the shelter of the brush
nearby, from which haven of refuge they might
watch to see what chances there were of the big
camp, a mile and more away, being broken up.</p>

<p>"I know what you're thinking about, Tubby,"
Merritt told him; "that none of us has had any
breakfast, and the outlook for dinner is about as
tough as it could be."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted the fat scout, "I feel just like
kicking myself, because I didn't think of doing
it when I had the chance."</p>

<p>"Doing what?" asked Merritt.</p>

<p>"Getting that good-natured old fellow at the
inn to put us up some lunch," was the explanation
Tubby offered. "I guess he'd have done it,
too, because he thought we deserved being taken
care of, after hearing what the wounded Belgian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>soldiers had to tell about us. Oh! it's a shame
how all my great thoughts come afterward.
What's the use of locking the stable door when
the horse has been stolen?"</p>

<p>"Well, cheer up," said Rob, who, of course,
had overheard what was being said; "it may not
be a case of starving."</p>

<p>"See here, you don't happen to have a lot of
stuff hidden away on your person, do you, Rob?"
gasped Tubby hopefully; and, as the other shook
his head, he continued in a mournful tone, "I
thought that would be too good to be true. But
please tell us what you mean by saying it mightn't
be so very serious. Mebbe you know of a henroost
nearby, where we might find a tough old
Dominick fowl that had been overlooked by
the raider squads from the camp?"</p>

<p>"If I did I'd tell you, Tubby; but wait a bit,
while we watch the camp. If nothing happens
inside of two hours, I've got a sort of scheme
to propose to you both, and I hope it'll meet with
your approbation."</p>

<p>"Two hours! Two long, weary hours! Gee!"
And, as Tubby said this, he proceeded to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>in some of the slack of his waistband, possibly
meaning to show Rob how terribly he had fallen
away of late.</p>

<p>They could see that myriads of men were moving
about on the level stretch of country where
the invaders were encamped. Fires were going,
and doubtless those excellent camp ovens, of
which so much had been written, were being
used to bake fresh bread for the day. Those
Germans omitted nothing that would provide for
the comfort of the enlisted men.</p>

<p>"It looks as though they meant to stay there
all day," remarked Rob, when they had been observing
these things for at least a full hour.</p>

<p>"Oh! Rob!" protested Tubby helplessly, as
though the information gave him a severe pain.</p>

<p>"Well, they believe in drilling right up to the
minute they go into battle," was what Merritt
remarked; "for there you can see a whole regiment
of them marching in review past the commander,
with others following behind."</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful sight," admitted Rob. "I
never saw soldiers keep step, and seem to be such
parts of a machine like that. You'd think they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>were moved by some network of wires, like a big
automatic engine."</p>

<p>"Oh! look what funny steps that first line is
practicing!" cried Tubby. "Why, they must be
only boys, and just playing soldiers. See how
they lift their feet, and go along like a high-stepper
of a horse. Ain't that the limit, now?"</p>

<p>"I tell you what that must be," said Rob,
quickly. "I've read about what they call the
'goose-step.' It's a flinging up of each leg, as
the step is taken, bending the knee, instead of
keeping it stiff, like most soldiers on parade do."</p>

<p>"The silly nonsense!" laughed Tubby. "What
would I look like trying that fancy step? I
thought the Kaiser had more sense than that."</p>

<p>"Hold on. Don't condemn a thing before you
know what it's meant for," said Rob. "There's
an object, and a mighty good one, about that
step, even if it does make most people smile when
they see it for the first time."</p>

<p>"Then let's hear what it is, please, Rob."</p>

<p>"As far as I know about it, the object is to
strengthen the muscles of the leg, and give those
that are tired from a set position a rest. Don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>you see how that sort of a movement relieves the
leg? Try it a few times, and you'll believe me."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen the goose-step before,
Rob?" asked Merritt.</p>

<p>"Only once, in a moving-picture play of the
German maneuvers," he was told. "It struck me
then as ridiculous; but I knew those German
military men had long heads, and would not start
a thing like that in a parade without something
big back of it. So, when I got home I tried it
a few times, and then I saw what a splendid relief
that throwing forward of the foot was.
There goes another line doing it."</p>

<p>They continued to crouch&mdash;there was small
possibility of any one discovering them&mdash;and
watched all that was going on in the busy camp
beyond.</p>

<p>Not once did any of the soldiers wander away.
It was plainly evident that they were being given
no liberties. Rob only hoped that the order
would come for this corps to get on the move,
and head to the southwest; for he did not doubt
but they were meaning to go to Ghent, or to some
other place toward the coast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>Several times Tubby was observed to crane his
neck and look up toward the heavens anxiously.
The others did not need to be told what those
signs indicated. They knew very well that the
fat chum had not become suddenly interested in
astronomy, or expected an eclipse of the sun to
happen. He was merely noting how far along
his morning journey the sky king had traveled,
because he could not forget how Rob had set
a time limit on their remaining there.</p>

<p>Two hours he had mentioned as the sum total
of their stay; when that boundary had been
reached Rob was going to make some sort of
pleasing proposition. Tubby hoped it would have
to do with the procuring of a certain nourishment,
of which all of them certainly stood in
great need.</p>

<p>At last Rob gave signs of making a move.</p>

<p>"Now, if you fellows will come back along the
road a little ways with me," he announced with
a smile, "I've got something to propose. I only
hope you fall in with my views, for then there's
a chance that we'll have something to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh! you can count on me agreeing with you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>Rob!" said Tubby cheerfully. "No matter
whether it's fur, fin, or feather, I think I could
do justice to nearly anything that grows."</p>

<p>"As it happens, it's something that doesn't fly
or walk that I have in my mind," Rob declared
rather mysteriously. "The fact is, it hops!"</p>

<p>"Now you have got me worse balled up than
ever," protested Tubby, his brow wrinkled with
his endeavor to guess the answer.</p>

<p>"I think I know," volunteered Merritt, grinning
amicably.</p>

<p>"What does he mean, then? Please hurry and
tell me," pleaded Tubby.</p>

<p>"Frogs, isn't it, Rob?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"Oh! gingersnaps and popguns! Do I have to
come down to choosing between eating jumpers
and starving to death?" complained the fat boy,
looking distressed.</p>

<p>"Well, wait till you get your first taste, that's
all," Rob told him. "If you don't say it beats
anything you ever took between your teeth, I'm
mistaken, and that's all there is about it. Why,
they're reckoned one of the fanciest dishes in all
the high-class clubs in America, along with dia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>mond-back
terrapin, canvas-back duck, and such
things. The only thing I'm afraid about is that
after you get your first taste you'll want to hog
the whole supply."</p>

<p>"But how shall we catch the frogs, and then
cook them?" asked Merritt.</p>

<p>"The first ought to be easy," replied Rob, "seeing
how plentiful they are, and how big and tame.
I see a dandy piece of wood that would make a
good bow with a piece of stout cord I've got in
my pocket. Merritt, get some of those straight
little canes, growing on the edge of the water.
We can make them do for arrows, and, even
without feathers, I think I can hit a big frog
with one at ten paces away. It'll be fun as well
as a profitable business. Frog-hunters, get busy
now."</p>

<p>"Here's a long pole, Rob. Shall I take it and
steal up close enough to whack a few of the
jumpers on the head?" asked Tubby, now entering
into the spirit of the game.</p>

<p>Being given permission, and warned not to
make too big a noise, lest he frighten all the
frogs into jumping, he set about his task. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>several failures he finally brought one monstrous
greenback frog to where the others were still
working.</p>

<p>"I'll show you how to cut off the saddle, and
skin the hind legs," said Rob.</p>

<p>Tubby did not altogether like this job. The
slimy feeling of the frog rather went against his
stomach. Still, after the large hind legs had been
duly skinned, they presented so much the appearance
of the white meat of a spring chicken
that Tubby felt encouraged enough to set forth
again.</p>

<p>He had four victims by the time Rob and Merritt
pronounced the bow and arrow part of the
business in readiness for work.</p>

<p>They kept at it steadily for an hour and more.
Rob found considerable excitement and profit in
his archery. His arrows could not be wholly
depended on, for they were not properly balanced;
but the distance was so short that he
made numerous fatal shots.</p>

<p>Merritt, too, had secured another long pole,
and joined Tubby in his share of the frog hunt.
It was exciting enough, and with more or less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>delicious little thrills connected with it. No
doubt the frogs must have enjoyed it immensely;
but then, no one bothered asking what they
thought of such tactics. A boy's hunger <i>must</i> be
allayed, and, if there were only frogs handy, why
so much the worse for the "hoppers."</p>

<p>"Whew! Don't you think we've got enough,
Rob?" asked Tubby, unable to stand it any
longer.</p>

<p>"What's the score?" asked the archer, as he
tossed still another great big victim toward the
spot where the fat scout had been counting the
pile.</p>

<p>"Twenty-one, all told," replied Tubby. "That
would mean seven for each. But how in the
world can we cook them? I hope now you don't
mean to tackle them raw? I love raw oysters,
but I'd draw the line at frogs. I'm no cannibal."</p>

<p>"Well, let's find a place deeper in the woods,
where we can make a fire out of selected dry
wood that will make so little smoke it can't be
noticed. That's an old Indian trick, you know.
Hunters used to practice it away back in the time
of Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton. When they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>were in a hostile country they had to be mighty
careful about making a smoke. I've tried it before,
and believe I can pick out the right kind
of fuel to use."</p>

<p>While the others were finishing the not very
pleasant work of skinning the numerous frog
saddles, Rob busied himself with making the fire
in a secluded neck of the woods. In the midst
of jutting stones he soon had a blaze going. It
could not be seen twenty feet away, on account
of the obstructions; and, as the proper kind of
wood had been selected, there was no smoke to
mention.</p>

<p>The boys would have given something for
their well-remembered frying pan, just at that
time, and some pieces of salt pork with which to
sweeten the dainty morsels which were to constitute
their luncheon. They were true scouts, however,
and could make the best of a bad bargain.</p>

<p>"All hunters do not have skillets when they're
in the woods," said Rob, as he took a long splinter
he had prepared, thrust it into one of the
saddles, and then, poking the other end into the
ground close to the fire, allowed the meat to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>the benefit of the heat. "We must do what we
can in this old-fashioned way. The best sauce,
after all, is hunger; and, from the look on Tubby's
face, I reckon he's fairly wild to set his teeth
in the first of the feast."</p>

<p>Pretty soon it was a lively scene, with all those
forks having to be attended to. A tempting odor
also began to rise up that made Tubby's mouth
fairly water. He heaved many a sigh, as he
waited for Rob to tell him that the first of his
allotment was sufficiently browned to be devoured.</p>

<p>"Now, let's begin," said Rob finally. "Only
look out not to burn your lips. And, Tubby, take
my word for it, you're going to get the treat of
your life!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE ARMORED CAR.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Honest, Rob, I never knew what I was missing
when I said toasted frogs' legs would do for
Frenchmen, but none for Merritt Crawford,"
and, while making this abject confession, the
speaker allowed a look of sublime content to possess
his features, such as would remove any lingering
doubt concerning his sincerity.</p>

<p>"How about you, Tubby?" asked the master
of ceremonies.</p>

<p>Tubby had been savagely tearing at his first
helping. His eyes were glued on the various
sticks under his charge, at the ends of which the
rear portions of as many frogs were dangling,
and turning a delicious brown under the influence
of the heat.</p>

<p>Then Tubby was seen to heave a sigh.</p>

<p>"To think that there are only <i>six</i> more apiece!"
he said in a most solemn tone. But the others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>laughed softly, because they knew any loud merriment,
under such peculiar conditions, was
hardly safe.</p>

<p>"That settles one thing," remarked Rob.
"There's going to be a marked reduction in the
profits of this particular frog-raiser this season,
if Tubby has to stay here long."</p>

<p>Tubby was already commencing on his second
batch. He could not waste time in talking when
his appetite had been excited to a feverish pitch
by the first bite of tender and succulent meat.</p>

<p>"Only thing I kick about," he presently mumbled,
throwing away the slender bones which he
had picked clean, "is that they go so quick.
Why, you hardly get started before you're at the
end."</p>

<p>"That's the way with nearly all good things,"
Merritt informed him. "Just as soon as they become
so numerous that you can have all you
want, somehow it seems as if the craving leaves
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess that's about it," admitted Tubby,
talking only because the next batch of provender
was not quite ready for disposal. "Anyhow, I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>seen my mother just dote on a horrible little cucumber
that dad brought home in January, paying
about twenty cents for the same, and, when
we have bushels of splendid ones in our own garden,
why, nobody cares to eat them."</p>

<p>The little feast continued until everybody had
cleaned up their mess. Tubby was disconsolate
because the supply was so limited and the demand
so great.</p>

<p>"How foolish we were not to double our
catch," he said several times, "for there wouldn't
have been any trouble about doing the same.
One thing I've settled in my mind, I want to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Well, go on, then, and explain," urged Merritt.</p>

<p>"I'll have one next summer, see if I don't," asserted
Tubby.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;a feast of frogs' legs?" chuckled the
other scout.</p>

<p>"Me? Only one show at the same? Well,
when I like a thing, I rave over it. I want it
every day. I mean to have a frog hatchery, and
a pond where I can raise 'em by the million!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>"Listen to him, will you, Rob?" exclaimed
Merritt, pretending to be horrified. "If ever
there was a case where eyes were bigger than a
stomach, it's right here. Millions of them, Tubby
wants now; seven is only a flea-bite to him."</p>

<p>"Oh! shucks! don't make me out a hog!" remonstrated
Tubby. "I didn't mean I expected to
devour the whole lot. Why, can't you see there's
good money in raising frogs? I'm going to get
the figures, and find out just what the ratio of
increase might reach. And my folks have got a
dandy marsh on the old farm back near Huntington
that we own. Rob, I thank you for opening
my eyes to this grand opportunity. I expect
it will be the turning point of my life yet."</p>

<p>They were used to hearing Tubby talk like this.
He often became inspired with ambition, but,
as time went on, the spirit died out, and something
new took its place.</p>

<p>"You're letting the little fire die out, I notice,
Rob," Merritt observed.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; we have no further use for it,"
he was told, "and there's always a small chance
that some soldier would be sent this way on an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>errand, when he might get a whiff of the smoke,
and take a notion to investigate. For one I'm
not hankering to be sent a prisoner of war to
some detention camp on the Rhine."</p>

<p>"And I'd feel pretty bad if my mission over
here turned out a fizzle," said Merritt, "because
my heart is set on getting that paper for Grandfather
Crawford."</p>

<p>"I'm going to propose," Tubby projected, as
though he could not tear his thoughts away from
the one fascinating subject as long as the taste
of his remarkable feast was still on his lips,
"that we put in a couple of hours' more work
getting a supply of these bouncing big frogs. If
the Germans stay right there the rest of the day
we want to lay in some provisions; and our choice
is limited, you know, to this one thing."</p>

<p>"Of course we could do that," Rob informed
him, "in case it was absolutely necessary; but
I've got a hunch that there's going to be a movement
of that army before sundown. If that
happens, we can get away from here, and find
some one to cook us a meal."</p>

<p>"Then you must have noticed signs that told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>they were beginning to get ready to go?" suggested
Merritt.</p>

<p>"Which was just what I did," replied Rob. "I
can hear certain sounds that tell me they have
received the order they were expecting, and are
breaking camp."</p>

<p>As all of them were anxious to learn whether
this glorious possibility could be really true or
not, they once more made their way back to the
spot where their former vigil had taken place.</p>

<p>"Why, the whole army is in motion, seems
like!" ejaculated Tubby.</p>

<p>"And a wonderful sight it is, at that," added
Merritt. "They can say what they please about
these German soldiers&mdash;and the Belgians feel
they've got a right to call them all sorts of hard
names, as barbarians and the like; but there never
was such remarkable discipline in the history of
the world. The huge army is like one vast machine.
Men count only as necessary cogs. When
one goes another takes its place, and the engine
grinds on."</p>

<p>They crouched there and watched every operation
from a safe distance. It seemed as though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>there was a never-ending procession of gray-coated
figures, most of them with the spiked helmets
on their heads, marching away in columns
toward the southwest. Then came batteries of
quick-firing guns, and heavier field pieces. The
clattering of accouterments, the neighing of
horses, and the hoarse singing of various regiments&mdash;all
these things came floating on the
breeze to the ears of the three lads, as they lay
there in the afternoon sunshine and watched.</p>

<p>"They seem particularly fond of certain
tunes," remarked Tubby, "and I know one is the
German national air, 'The Watch on the Rhine,'
because we've sung it many a time in the school
at Hampton. What's that other they roar out,
Rob?"</p>

<p>"I think it's a popular patriotic German air,
called <i>Deutschland ueber Alles</i>, which means, of
course, 'Germany Over All'," Rob obligingly replied.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, every country's sons believe they
ought to have the first place in the sun; and I
reckon we Americans have done a heap of boast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>ing
that way," Merritt remarked, which seemed
to be about what Tubby thought, too.</p>

<p>So they lay there until the camp was entirely
deserted. Never would those three scouts forget
the spectacle to which they had been treated that
day.</p>

<p>It was now along toward the middle of the
afternoon. Far off in the distance somewhere,
an action was certainly going on, for the grumble
of heavy cannonading came almost constantly to
their ears.</p>

<p>"Chances are," said Rob, as they prepared to
vacate their refuge and once more push onward,
"there's a fierce battle in progress, and this corps
has received orders to get on the firing line.
That would account for the way the troops were
singing. Their business is to fight, and most of
them are only happy when they can smell burnt
powder, hear the crash of bursting shrapnel, and
the heavy boom of big shells."</p>

<p>"We've seen one battle," observed Tubby with
a shudder, "and for myself I'm not hankering
after a second experience."</p>

<p>"I suppose in time we'd get used to such terri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>ble
things," Rob pursued in a reflective way, "for
even the fellow who nearly swoons away in his
first fight, they say, becomes a regular fire-eater
after a while; but, so far as I'm concerned, I'll
be a happy boy when I see good old peaceful Long
Island again, with its sandy beaches, and the familiar
things we love."</p>

<p>"We all will, Rob," remarked Tubby fervently,
a yearning expression coming over his rosy face,
as in imagination he again saw the home folks,
and sat down to a table that fairly groaned with
the good things he doted on.</p>

<p>"Yes, after I've carried out my mission I'll be
just as glad to start back as either of you fellows,"
Merritt assured them.</p>

<p>The last of the Germans had disappeared from
view when the boys started out. Rob was looking
a bit serious, and the other noticed that he
kept turning his eyes off toward the right, for it
was in that direction the great host had gone.</p>

<p>"You don't expect they will turn back and give
us trouble, do you, Rob?" asked Merritt, noticing
this frequent look.</p>

<p>"No; it isn't that," he was told, "but I'm won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>dering
what a certain movement that I happened
to notice could mean."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, won't you, Rob?" Tubby
implored. "It can't be that we have to take
the same road that army marched away
along, because we're heading in just the other
quarter."</p>

<p>Before Rob could commence with his explanation
they heard the sound of what appeared to be
an automobile behind them. At the time they
chanced to be at the foot of a slight elevation,
which rose for perhaps twenty feet in a gradual
ascent.</p>

<p>"Gingersnaps and popguns! Look what's
bearing down on us, will you?" gasped Tubby.</p>

<p>"It's an armored automobile, as sure as anything!"
added Merritt, "just like that car we saw
in Antwerp, you know. Yes, I can see the muzzle
of the deadly Maxim gun that's back of that
metal shield. Rob, it's heading straight at us.
What if they take us for Germans, and open
fire?"</p>

<p>"Oh! for goodness' sake, let's wave a white
flag to keep them from mowing us down like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>wheat!" exclaimed Tubby, commencing to fumble
in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Hold up your hands to show that we have
no arms!" ordered Rob, abruptly. "They are
Belgians, and perhaps the same daring fellows
we saw come into Antwerp with all sorts of spoils
to show they had made a raid, and shot down
their regular allotment of the enemy. Yes, wave
the white bag, if you want, Tubby; we don't
mean to take any chances."</p>

<p>"It's a hard thing to be shot down, and then
have some one say they're sorry, and that they
didn't know the gun was loaded," remarked Merritt.</p>

<p>The armored car slowed down as it approached.
Those vigilant Belgians aboard were
doubtless observing the three figures in khaki
closely. Already they must have discovered that
they were Boy Scouts. Possibly they more than
half expected to find they were Belgian scouts,
for such boys were being used as dispatch bearers
all over the war zone.</p>

<p>"We are friends!" called out Rob, "American
boys, who belong to the scouts over in our coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>try,
you understand? We have nothing to do
with the war. Do any of you speak English?
I can talk in French a little, if it's necessary."<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;">

</div>

<p><br />The three Belgian soldiers laughed at that.
Plainly they had been at a loss to place these
three lads.</p>

<p>"I happen to be able to talk English very
good," one of them called out, as the car stopped,
"and we are glad to meet you. Americans are
good friends of ours."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Rob impressively, "if you keep
on the road you expect to take, so as to follow
the German army corps, you will fall into an
ambush inside of three minutes."</p>

<h3>TURNING THE TABLES.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>When Rob made this astonishing statement his
two chums suddenly realized that this must be
the matter he had been on the point of explaining
to them when the armored car from Antwerp
came tearing along the road in their rear like a
modern war chariot.</p>

<p>The leader of the three Belgian soldiers, and
who seemed to be a captain, looked incredulous.
He repeated what Rob had said to his backers, in
Flemish; and they, too, observed the scout with
wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"This is a strange thing you are telling me,
boy," remarked the captain. "How is it you
know there is an ambuscade laid to catch us napping?"</p>

<p>"I will gladly explain," the Eagle Patrol leader
hastened to say. "You see, we want to get to
Sempst, and, as we helped the Red Cross on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>battlefield yesterday, we were detained. Then
we found that there was a German army camped
right in our way. It moved off toward the front
only an hour ago, and we have been hiding most
of the day. But, while we were watching the
troops depart, I was surprised to see a single gun
taken into a patch of scrub on a little elevation
that commands the road. It is pointed this way,
and you can never notice it there unless you have
been posted. Now I can guess what they are
hiding for; they expect that you may be along,
and mean to rid the German army of your stinging
them so often!"</p>

<p>Tubby's mouth was wide open. He stared at
Rob as though he hardly knew whether he were
awake or asleep. Even Merritt seemed thrilled
by what he had heard.</p>

<p>As for the Belgian captain, it was an incredulous
look that gripped his features.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to believe, boy," he said,
looking earnestly at Rob.</p>

<p>"The best way is to prove it," that worthy told
him immediately.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>
<p>"It would at least be convincing," the pilot of
the armored car declared.</p>

<p>"Suppose, then," continued the scout, "you
leave your car here at the foot of this little rise.
They couldn't see us with that hump between.
Go up the hill, and look along the road. You
needn't let them see you, of course; but I notice
that you've got a pair of field-glasses along. Follow
the road with those until you come to a little
break in the stone wall that lies around a patch
of field on the right. It is this knoll I spoke of,
crowned with brush. Watch that brush closely
for a minute; perhaps you will see the sun glint
from the gun; or else one of the hidden German
gunners may move ever so slightly. That will
tell the story, captain."</p>

<p>The pilot of the armored car jumped out.</p>

<p>"I will do as you say, at least it can be no
harm," he remarked hastily.</p>

<p>After speaking in Flemish to his companions,
he started up the rise, carrying the field-glasses
and a revolver along with him. Watching, they
saw him get down and crawl the last yard or so;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>and then evidently he found a way to level his
glasses in the quarter under suspicion.</p>

<p>Five minutes later and he backed off, coming
quickly down the little declivity. The first thing
he did was to grip Rob's hand and squeeze it
fiercely.</p>

<p>"I have to thank you for my life, and the lives
of my brave comrades as well!" he said with
fervor.</p>

<p>"Then you found that what I told you was
exactly so?" Rob asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is an ambuscade," replied the soldier.
"They must have suspected that we would
chase after the army so as to pick up stragglers,
because that is our favorite game these terrible
days; anything to sting the snake that is crawling
across our beloved country and leaving death and
destruction behind."</p>

<p>"You will not go ahead after learning what is
waiting there, I suppose, Captain?" Rob continued.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my boy, because they have the
range plotted out, and, when we reached a certain
spot, one shot would blow the car and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>three of us to pieces. Our play is to go around
another way. But why have you done this for
us, when you say, as Americans, you must be
neutral?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know," replied Rob. "Up to lately
we have not felt like favoring either side, because
we have many good German friends at
home. But what we have seen and heard here in
Belgium is beginning to turn us to the side of the
Allies. You see, I could not watch you rush
right to your death, knowing what I did. Perhaps,
if the tables had been turned I might have
warned a German pilot to turn around before it
was too late."</p>

<p>"Well, you have done us a great favor, and we
thank you," said the Belgian soldier, with considerable
feeling; after which he conversed with
his two comrades for a minute or so, no doubt
explaining what had awaited them close by; and
that only for the timely warning of the Americans
they would have been launched into eternity.</p>

<p>Then the car was turned around, and away
the three dashing Belgians sped. The last the
boys saw of them was when they waved their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>hands back ere vanishing around a curve in the
road.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tubby, "that was a splendid thing
you did, Rob. And to think you noticed the Germans
laying that cute little ambush there! It
shows what training will do for a fellow, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It is only what every scout is supposed to do,"
replied Rob, thinking to impress a lesson on Tubby's
mind. "Observe every little thing that happens,
and draw your own conclusions from it.
When I saw that gun going up into the field, I
wondered what they meant by that. Then I saw
they were laying a trap. I couldn't believe it
was intended for us, and so I was puzzled, because
we didn't expect to use that road at all."</p>

<p>"And when the armored car came whizzing
along you knew the Germans meant to get the
Belgians who had been doing so much damage
day after day, as we'd heard; that was it, eh,
Rob?" and Merritt nodded his head sagely, as
though things were all as plain as anything to
him now.</p>

<p>"Huh!" snorted Tubby, "after Columbus had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>cracked the end of the egg and stood it up, didn't
those Spanish courtiers all say that was as easy
as pie? Course we can see things after they've
happened. But you and me, Merritt, had better
be digging the scales off our eyes, so we can
discover things for ourselves next time."</p>

<p>Merritt did not answer back. Truth to tell he
realized that he merited a rebuke for his lack of
observation. It might pass with an ordinary boy,
but was inexcusable in a scout who had been
trained to constantly use his faculties for observation
wherever he went.</p>

<p>"Our road will take us past that place where
they are hiding, won't it, Rob?" he presently said.
"Suppose, now, they guessed that we must have
turned the armored car back, and lost them their
victims, wouldn't they be likely to take it out on
us, thinking we might be Belgian Boy Scouts?"</p>

<p>"I had that in my mind, Merritt," admitted
Rob, "and for that reason I reckon we ought to
leave the road right here. We can make a wide
detour, and strike it further along, where the
danger will be past."</p>

<p>All of them were of the same mind. They did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>not fancy taking any chance of having that concealed
six-pounder discharged point-blank at
them. Mistakes are hard to rectify after a fatal
volley has been fired. The best way is to avoid
running any chances.</p>

<p>They found a way to leave the road and take
to the fields, skirting fences, and in every way
possible managing to keep out of sight of the
German gunners who were lying concealed in
that scrub on the little elevation.</p>

<p>It was while they were pushing on some distance
away that without the least warning they
caught a strange pulsating rattling sound from
the rear. All of them came to a stop, and wondering
looks were quickly changed to those of
concern.</p>

<p>"Rob," exclaimed Merritt, "it comes from
near where that gun lies hidden back of the
bushes; and that's the rattle of a Maxim, as sure
as you live. Those Belgians have turned the
tables on the Germans; they've managed to sneak
around back of them, and must be pouring in a
terrible fire that will mow down every gunner in
that bunch of brush!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>Rob was a little white in the face, as he continued
to listen to the significant discharge. He
had seen what mischief one of those Maxim guns
could do at fairly close quarters, for they had
witnessed them at work during the battle of the
preceding day.</p>

<p>"I feel bad about it in one way," he said, "because
in saving the lives of those three Belgians
we have been the means of turning the trap on
those who set it. But I never dreamed they
would try to surprise the men in ambush."</p>

<p>The sounds died out, and silence followed;
though the far-away grumble of the conflict
could be heard from time to time.</p>

<p>"They've launched their bolt," said Merritt,
"and either skipped out again, or else the German
battery has been placed out of commission.
We didn't hear the six-pounder go off, so they
had no chance to fire back."</p>

<p>They continued their walk in silence. All of
them had been much sobered by these thrilling
and momentous events that were continually
happening around them. Much of the customary
jolly humor that, as a rule, characterized their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>intercourse with one another had been, by degrees,
crushed by the tragedies that they had seen
happening everywhere among the poor Belgians
and amid the stricken soldiers whom they had so
nobly assisted on the field of battle.</p>

<p>Striking the little road again at some distance
beyond, they continued to follow it, under the
belief that they could not now be very far away
from the town they were aiming to reach.</p>

<p>Before they entirely lost sight of the late encampment
of the German army, the boys discovered
that a number of peasants from the surrounding
country had come on the scene, and appeared
to be hunting for anything of value which
might have been purposely or by accident left
behind.</p>

<p>"The poor things know they're going to have
the hardest winter ever," said Tubby, with considerable
feeling in his voice, "and they're trying
to find something to help out. Like as not
some of them even came from Louvain, where
they lost everything they had in the wide world
when the place was burned to the ground. It's
just awful, that's what it is. America looks like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>the only place left where there's a chance of keeping
the peace."</p>

<p>As they went along Rob was keeping track
of their course. He gave Merritt his reasons
for believing they would reach Sempst before
sunset after all, unless something entirely unexpected
happened to delay them again.</p>

<p>"Just now we're in great luck," he finished.
"So far as we can see the Germans have cleared
out of this particular section completely. They
may be back again to-morrow; you never can
tell what they'll do. But the main line of railroad
is where they are mostly moving, because in that
way they can get their supplies of men, guns,
ammunition and food, and also take back the
wounded. Some of their dead are buried, but in
the main they prefer to cremate them, which is
the modern way to prevent disease following battles."</p>

<p>Merritt did not make any remark, for he was
becoming more and more anxious the closer they
drew to the town where he expected to have that
question of the success or failure of his mission
settled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>Rob knew how strained his nerves must be.
He could feel for his chum, and it was only natural
for him to want to buoy up Merritt's sinking
hopes.</p>

<p>"Don't get downcast, old fellow," he told him.
"You've stuck it out through thick and thin so
far. Whether you find this Steven Meredith in
Sempst or not, you're bound to meet up with him
somewhere, sooner or later, you know."</p>

<p>Merritt gritted his teeth, and the old look of
resolution came across his face, which the others
knew full well.</p>

<p>"Thank you for saying that, Rob," he observed
steadily. "You know that once my mind is made
up I'm a poor one to cry quits. I'll follow that
man to China, or the headwaters of the Amazon,
if necessary, but I'll never give up as long as I
can put one foot in front of the other."</p>

<p>"And," said Tubby vehemently, "here are two
loyal comrades who mean to stick to you, Merritt,
to the very end."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"I think we're coming to Sempst," said Rob.</p>

<p>It was nearly half an hour after Merritt had
so firmly announced his intention of staying in
the game, no matter if he should meet with a bitter
disappointment in the town, which had been
the loadstone for their advance through the heart
of war-stricken Belgium.</p>

<p>"Then Brussels can't be very far away, over
there," said Tubby. "Gee! I only wish we could
find some scarecrows about now, and get a
change of clothes."</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" asked Rob. "I
thought you were so proud of your suit of khaki
that nothing could tempt you to give it up."</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't mean I'd really want to discard
this bully suit," Tubby hastened to explain. "Only
if we could manage to conceal the scout uniform
under something more common, why, you see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>Germans might take us for Belgian boys, and in
that case wouldn't molest us."</p>

<p>"I understand what he's getting at, Rob," Merritt
chuckled, "Tubby has said a number of times
that the one thing he was sorry about was that
we couldn't have a run through Brussels. Seems
like he got a great notion he wanted to visit there,
as he'd read a lot about the wonderful city. But
you'll have to let that longing sleep until the next
time you come abroad, Tubby."</p>

<p>"Unless we happen to find we've got business
in Brussels," observed the other cunningly.
"Then mebbe we might decide we'd find a way
to go in. 'Course I mean if they told us here in
Sempst that Mr. Steven Meredith, who seems to
be a pretty smart secret agent of the German
Government, had changed his residence to Brussels,
so as to be in touch with army headquarters
and the General Staff. How about that, Merritt?"</p>

<p>"We won't cross rivers before we come to
them," Rob hastened to remark, not wishing the
other to fully commit himself to any course.
"After coming so far with the intention to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>our man here in this little town, it seems silly to
get cold feet when we're right on the spot, and
before we know anything that's against our having
the best of success."</p>

<p>"Oh! you're right, Rob," agreed Tubby. "You
remember the old motto we used to write in our
copybooks at school long ago&mdash;'sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof.' Guess that's from
the Good Book, too; but it applies to our case,
all the same. We'll wait till we see what is going
to happen here in Sempst. Anyway, they
haven't burned this little place down, because I
don't see anything that looks like ruins."</p>

<p>Indeed, it seemed as though the peasants living
close to Brussels had been induced by the Germans
to continue their regular field work, under
promise of purchasing for fair prices all the
green stuff they could fetch into the capital.
They, mostly women, old decrepit men, and children,
for even the smallest could be given some
task that would help out, were working in the
fields.</p>

<p>"I wonder if any of them could understand
my French," Rob was saying. "Of course it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>wouldn't be likely they could talk English. I've
got a good notion to try it on the first one we
meet on the road ahead."</p>

<p>"Do it, Rob," urged Tubby. "Merritt and I
will stand by to catch him if he starts to faint."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope my French isn't quite that bad,"
exclaimed Rob. "I've been polishing it up considerable,
you know, while on the steamer, and after
we landed in Belgium; and, with what I know,
and by pointing and shrugging my shoulders, I
generally manage to make people understand.
Of course, I don't know how it would be with a
clodhopper who didn't happen to be as intelligent
as I'd want. But here's a chance, and I'm
going to make the attempt."</p>

<p>"It won't kill, even if it doesn't cure," said
Merritt; "and, Rob, if you can get him to understand
what you're saying, be sure and ask if that
chemical factory, where we understood Steven
had been given his responsible berth, has shut
down, or if it is still in operation."</p>

<p>"I'll do that, Merritt," the other promised.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the peasant, smoking his
big pipe, came along in his wooden shoes, Rob
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>stopped him. He wanted to impress the fellow
favorably, so as to increase the prospect for a
favorable answer; and so Rob made sure to have
one of his famous smiles on his bright face when
he began to air his French.</p>

<p>The other boys stood there watching the "circus,"
as Tubby called it. They saw, however,
that Rob, many times at a loss for words in order
to express his meaning, must have managed to
make the peasant understand him.</p>

<p>Again and again each of them pointed toward
the town so near at hand. Possibly Rob may
have been explaining just who he and his chums
were, and also how they had come all the way
from Antwerp with the one hope of finding a
certain person in this little suburb.</p>

<p>"He's picking up some kind of news, seems
like," Merritt told Tubby, as the dialogue progressed
under so many difficulties, expressive
movements of the shoulders, and waving hands
taking the place of words that failed.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" demanded the
fat scout.</p>

<p>"Look at Rob's face, and you can tell that he's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>feeling more or less satisfied with the way things
are going on," replied Merritt.</p>

<p>"Gosh! that's so," muttered Tubby. "Seems
you're getting a move on, too, with observing
things. I'll have to hurry and do something myself,
if I don't want to find that I'm no first-class
scout, after all, but only a dub."</p>

<p>Finally Rob was seen to press a coin in the
calloused palm of the peasant, who took off his
cap and bowed several times, as though grateful,
and then he continued on his way along the road.</p>

<p>"What luck?" asked Tubby immediately;
while Merritt, more deeply interested than any
of them, silently waited to listen.</p>

<p>"Oh! he gave me quite some information," replied
Rob; "and, so far as I can see, it looks good
for us. I didn't learn anything about Steven
Meredith, because the farm laborer probably
never heard of such a person; but he did tell me
that the chemical works have been kept going full
blast ever since the Germans occupied Brussels."</p>

<p>"That must be because certain things are made
there that they can use in their war game, eh,
Rob?" Merritt conjectured, and the other nodded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>"No question about it," he said, "though the
peasant couldn't say why certain things were
done, only that they did happen. But, if the factory
is running wide open, there seems to be a
chance that we may find Steven still on deck, and
keeping his finger on the pulse."</p>

<p>"I'm only afraid that if he really is what we
think, a secret agent of the government," Merritt
suggested uneasily, "that he may have been
transferred to some other point where his smartness
would be apt to count, perhaps away down
in France, so that he could send up valuable information
about the making of artillery, or how
the conscription of the Nineteen-Fifteen boy recruits
is coming on."</p>

<p>"Still, to find the works open, and doing business
right along, looks like a piece of good luck
to me," said Tubby.</p>

<p>"It is," added Rob positively. "We agreed
long ago that we'd consider it such, if we learned
there had been no shutdown. We hoped it would
be that way, for we already knew that German
capital had been back of the chemical works. I
wouldn't be much surprised if it was learned that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>somewhere about the place, unknown to most
people, these clever Germans had long ago built
a heavy concrete floor, to be used in their business;
but which would make the best kind of
foundation for one of those big siege guns they
used to knock down the Liège and Namur forts."</p>

<p>When Rob said this he did not dream how
closely he was hitting the truth. It had not been
discovered at that time how secret preparations
along such lines had been made by the Germans,
year after year, in close proximity to many of
the leading cities in Belgium, France, and even
over in England.</p>

<p>"Well, now for moving on, and entering the
town," Merritt remarked, with a look on his
face that told how he was summoning all his
resolution so as not to appear too heartbroken
should they meet with bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>"I hope we don't run across any German soldiers
here," said Tubby.</p>

<p>"We want to keep on the constant watch for
them," Rob gave warning. "If they saw us, they
might think it their duty to have us arrested at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>once, and detained until our story could be investigated."</p>

<p>"And that would spell ruin for all our plans,
wouldn't it?" Merritt asked, not as cheerfully as
he might, because he had been fearful all along
that something like this might come to pass just
when he had discovered the object of his long
search, and before he could proceed to relieve
Steven Meredith of the old case in which he
carried those splendid field-glasses.</p>

<p>They were now among the outer houses of the
town. So far as they could see, Sempst did not
differ to any degree from various other Belgian
towns they had seen. It consisted of numerous
small houses, a few more pretentious dwellings,
possibly of Brussels business men, and some factories.</p>

<p>From only one of these stacks was smoke seen
coming, and, having picked up a pointer, it was
easy for the scouts to decide that this must be
the German-owned chemical works with which
Steven Meredith had been connected, between
his foreign trips.</p>

<p>When thus entering the town that was so close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>to Brussels, where the Germans were in full
charge, it was the policy of the three scouts to
draw as little attention to themselves as possible.
While thus far they had not chanced to notice
any German soldiers, still there was always a
possibility that some of them were around.</p>

<p>Besides, Rob figured that if a German-owned
chemical factory had been in operation here for
years, very naturally there would be many natives
of the Rhine country employed there, and
living in the town. If the German government
were really back of this Belgian works, as seemed
possible, they would want to have mostly reliable
men on guard, who, in case of sudden emergency,
could throw off their workmen's garb and show
themselves in their true colors, as regularly enlisted
soldiers, serving their superiors while plying
their regular trade.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the boys heard loud outcries,
after entering the town, and made the distressing
discovery that there was a runaway approaching
them, the first thought Rob had was that they
must keep out of the way, and not interfere, lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>by so doing they attract attention toward themselves.</p>

<p>With this discreet plan of action rapidly forming
in his mind, Rob was even in the act of hastily
drawing both his chums back behind a wall
until all the excitement had subsided, when he
made a discovery that brought his scheme to a
halt.</p>

<p>It was, after all, only a pony that had been
seized with an attack of blind staggers, and was
now dashing frantically away, with a little basket-cart
dragging back and forth at his heels;
but in that cart Rob saw was a frightened child.</p>

<p>In that moment, Rob struggled with a grave
question. To show themselves before a crowd
such as would likely gather, was full of danger,
not only to themselves, but for their mission as
well. At the same time there was a something
within his soul that refused to avoid the responsibility
by shutting his eyes.</p>

<p>He could not do it. He knew that child was in
deadly peril, for, small as the pony might be,
just then he was acting like a little demon. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>he allowed the runaway to go by, and something
dreadful happened, how could he ever reconcile
his action with his vows as a true-blue scout?</p>

<p>So Rob's mind was made up.</p>

<p>"Merritt, we must save that poor little child,
come what will!" he exclaimed; and that loyal
comrade, forgetting all else for humanity's sake,
instantly cried:</p>

<p>"We will, Rob! Hurry and get on one side,
while I look out for the other!"</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Where do I come in? Won't you let me
help?" bawled Tubby, hurrying after his two
chums as fast as his fat legs would carry him.</p>

<p>Neither of the others paid the slightest attention
to him. Just then Tubby was about as useless
as a fifth wheel to a wagon. He was so
clumsy that if he attempted to take a hand in
the rescue work the chances were Rob and Merritt
would have to spend a portion of their time
in saving him.</p>

<p>They ran out into the middle of the road. The
crazy little pony was already close up, and there
was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>"Now!" shouted Rob. "Nab him, and throw
him if you can!"</p>

<p>Both scouts fastened upon the bridle close to
the bit. Every ounce of muscle the boys pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>sessed
was brought to bear, supplemented by all
the shrewdness they had acquired upon the football
field, in tackling and throwing the runner
who held the coveted pigskin oval.</p>

<p>There was something of a struggle, and then
down went the frantic pony.</p>

<p>"Hey! let me sit on him; I'll keep him quiet!"
called Tubby, as he came panting up to the spot;
and once he had deposited his extra weight upon
the little beast, it had no other course open but
to succumb to circumstances and lie quiet.</p>

<p>Rob turned to see what had become of the child.
There was a stout, red-faced man, coming on the
run as fast as he could hurry. Undoubtedly it
was his child. While he was in a store, the pony
probably had been taken with a sudden seizure
of what Rob called "blind staggers," which sometimes
causes horses to dash madly away as
though possessed of an evil spirit, and even to
destroy themselves against any barrier that arises
in their path.</p>

<p>The child, though crying with fright, was apparently
unhurt. Some one had taken her from
the basket-cart, and should the pony have broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>loose again, it could not have imperiled the little
one.</p>

<p>In another minute, the red-faced man was hugging
his child, and covering her face with kisses.
The people must have told him who had saved
his darling, for he came up to Rob and Merritt.
(The pony had now become quite calm, though
Tubby continued to occupy his seat, for, as he
afterwards said, "he knew a good thing when he
found it; and he was <i>awful</i> tired.")</p>

<p>The big stout man, evidently a German, from
his appearance and language, began to pour out
his thanks; but Rob shook his head as he remarked:</p>

<p>"None of us can speak German, sir. We are
American boys, you see; I can understand a little
French, but that is all."</p>

<p>The man's face lighted up. He immediately
seized Rob by the hand and commenced to kiss
him on the cheeks; but the boys had learned that
this was the common method of warm salutation
abroad, even among men, though they had never
seen it done across the water.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are American and not Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>lish!"
the other went on to cry. "I would be
sorry, indeed, if I owed the life of my little
Frieda to an English boy. But an American, it
is quite different. Ach! what would I not do to
show you how grateful I am for your brave act?
Tell me, can I not do something to prove that in
Germany we look upon your country as our
friends? My name it is Herr Frederick Haskins,
I am the principal owner of the chemical works
over yonder. Let me be your host while in
Sempst you stay. It would give me much pleasure,
I assure you."</p>

<p>Rob stared at Merritt, and the latter almost
held his breath. Was there ever such great luck
as this? They had saved a child from danger,
and made a warm friend of her father, who had
turned out to be the proprietor of the very factory
where Steven Meredith had an interest outside
of his occupation as a secret agent of the
Kaiser.</p>

<p>"Rob, ask him!" whispered Merritt, too overcome
himself to find words in which to give utterance
to what was weighing so heavily on his
mind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>
<p>So the patrol leader, mastering his inclination
to feel just as "shaky" as Corporal Crawford,
turned again toward the red-faced German
chemist.</p>

<p>"We might accept your kind offer of entertainment
for to-night, Herr Haskins," he said,
as though they took the man's sincerity for its
face value, "because we will have to put up somewhere,
though to-morrow it may be we shall
want to start back toward Antwerp again. You
said that you were the proprietor of the chemical
company in town. Are those the works where
the smoke is coming out of the stacks?"</p>

<p>The man nodded. He held his little girl in his
arm, as though he could not bear to let her be
away from him again. A look of what seemed
to be pride crept over his face; it meant something
that his was the only factory that had been
kept running, simply because his foreign hands
did not have to go when the call to the Belgian
colors came.</p>

<p>"It is because I have the confidence of the
German government that I am allowed to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>tinue
my works," he said in a low tone, as though
not wishing others to hear what he was saying.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," continued Rob, bound to
learn the worst immediately, now that such a
golden opportunity had come along, "but it was
to see a man connected with your business that
we came all the way from Antwerp. His name
is Mr. Steven Meredith, who was over in America
not so many months ago."</p>

<p>It was apparent that they were going to meet
with a keen disappointment; Rob knew this the
second he saw the shade of regret pass over the
rubicund face of Herr Haskins.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is really too bad," the stout man
exclaimed; "for you are just one week too late!"</p>

<p>"Has he left Sempst, then?" asked Merritt
sturdily.</p>

<p>"Just seven days ago he shook hands with me,
and said I could look for him when I saw him
again. That might be in a month, and it might
be six, even Steven could not say. He simply
had to obey his orders from his superiors. His
interest in the works is not the only thing he follows,
you understand."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>"No," said Rob, mysteriously, looking carefully
around, as though he wanted to make sure
he was not overheard, "of course we know his
other business. The General Staff has ordered
him again on duty somewhere. It is too bad,
because my friend here wishes to see Herr Meredith
very much, indeed."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," remarked the stout man, in a
hesitating way, and Rob knew that if he hoped to
get any information from this source at all now
was the time to strike&mdash;while the iron was hot.</p>

<p>"You say you are grateful, sir," he hurriedly
whispered, "because we happened to save your
little girl's life, or at least kept her from being
badly injured. We would call the debt canceled
if you could tell us where we can find Herr Meredith.
If he is in France, tell us where."</p>

<p>The man did not immediately reply. His face
was a study. He was undoubtedly being torn
between gratitude and devotion to the interests
of his emperor, whom he would have died to
serve, no doubt.</p>

<p>"If I could only be sure it was right for me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>give you that information," Rob heard him mutter,
and he hastened to follow up his attack.</p>

<p>"I give you my word of honor, Herr Haskins,"
he said earnestly and convincingly, "that none of
us has the slightest intention to betray Steven
Meredith to his enemies. If you write down the
information we need, we solemnly promise you
not to use it to his injury. My friend only wants
to get a small thing Herr Meredith has with
him, although he himself does not know it is in
his possession, for it was all a mistake about his
taking it. He will be only too glad to give it to
us, and we shall trouble him no more. Won't
you take our word of honor, sir?"</p>

<p>The big man looked down at his child, and that
must have decided him.</p>

<p>"Come home with me, and spend the night,"
he said in a hospitable way. "We will entertain
you the best we can under the peculiar conditions
existing here. If you care to, you can tell me
all about yourselves; and I promise you that before
you go to sleep this night I will place in
your possession an address in Northern France
where you will likely find my partner, <i>under an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>other
name</i>. But you must swear to me that under
no conditions will you imperil his position
there. Is it a bargain, my boys?"</p>

<p>Rob looked at Merritt. The latter, although
terribly disappointed, was still game. He gave
not the slightest sign of submitting to the decrees
of a cruel Fate.</p>

<p>"We will accept your hospitality, Herr Haskins,"
he said quietly, "and also take from you
that address under the promise you ask. Steven
Meredith has no reason to fear that we will betray
him. We are Americans, and our President
has asked that every one, old and young, remain
strictly neutral while this war is going on."</p>

<p>"We bound up the wounds of three times as
many Germans after the battle as we did Belgians,"
Rob added, while Tubby was heard to
mutter under his breath:</p>

<p>"Which was because there were ten times as
many Germans hurt as there were of the brave
little Belgian army."</p>

<p>They accompanied Herr Haskins to his fine
home, where they were splendidly entertained
that night. Tubby ate so much dinner that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>incapable of joining in the conversation that immediately
followed, though that fact was of
minor importance, because, as a rule, he only
made himself a nuisance when there was any
serious discussion on hand.</p>

<p>At least, if they had to be disappointed in not
finding the man they had come so far to deal
with, they could deem themselves lucky in meeting
Herr Haskins under conditions that placed
him heavily in their debt; otherwise they might
never have discovered in what direction Steven
Meredith had gone when his superiors in the
German Secret Service ordered him on duty
again.</p>

<p>As it was, when the boys on the following
morning once more headed in the direction of
Antwerp, armed with a letter from Herr Haskins
that would be of considerable service should
they be held up by any German patrol, Merritt
also had a small bit of paper secreted inside the
lining of his coat, on which simply an address
was written.</p>

<p>As they journeyed they had plenty of opportunities
to lay out their new program and build
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>fresh castles in the air concerning the success
which they meant to attain if it lay in mortal
power.</p>

<p>Whether they were as fortunate in the new
fields that now stretched before them as they
had been in avoiding pitfalls between the battle
lines in Belgium, you will find recorded in the
next volume of this series, under the title of
"The Boy Scouts with the Allies in France."</p>

<h3>The Boy Scouts on the Range.</h3>

<p>Connected with the dwellings of the vanished
race of cliff-dwellers was a mystery. Who
so fit to solve it as a band of adventurous Boy
Scouts? The solving of the secret and the routing
of a bold band of cattle thieves involved Rob
Blake and his chums, including "Tubby" Hopkins,
in grave difficulties.</p>

<p>There are few boys who have not read of
the weird snake dance and other tribal rites of
Moquis. In this volume, the habits of these fast
vanishing Indians are explained in interesting
detail. Few boys' books hold more thrilling
chapters than those concerning Rob's captivity
among the Moquis.</p>

<p>Through the fascinating pages of the narrative
also stalks, like a grim figure of impending
tragedy, the shaggy form of Silver Tip, the giant
grizzly. In modern juvenile writing, there is
little to be found as gripping as the scene in
which Rob and Silver Tip meet face to face.
The boy is weaponless and,&mdash;but it would not
be fair to divulge the termination of the battle.
A book which all Boy Scouts should secure and
place upon their shelves to be read and re-read.</p>

<h3>The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol.</h3>

<p>A fascinating narrative of the doings of some
bright boys who become part of the great Boy
Scout movement. The first of a series dealing
with this organization, which has caught on like
wild fire among healthy boys of all ages and in
all parts of the country.</p>

<p>While in no sense a text-book, the volume
deals, amid its exciting adventures, with the
practical side of Scouting. To Rob Blake and
his companions in the Eagle Patrol, surprising,
and sometimes perilous things happen constantly.
But the lads, who are, after all, typical
of most young Americans of their type, are
resourceful enough to overcome every one of
their dangers and difficulties.</p>

<p>How they discover the whereabouts of little
Joe, the "kid" of the patrol, by means of smoke
telegraphy and track his abductors to their disgrace;
how they assist the passengers of a stranded
steamer and foil a plot to harm and perhaps
kill an aged sea-captain, one must read the book
to learn. A swift-moving narrative of convincing
interest and breathless incident.</p>
